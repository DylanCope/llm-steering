Travis Carlton

A South Carolina woman was injured in a multi-vehicle crash as she rushed to a hospital with her 4-year-old son, who had been shot in the chest by his father during a domestic dispute.

Travis Carlton was arrested in connection with the shooting, but the 21-year-old Easley man has not yet been formally charged.

Witnesses said the woman began screaming after the Monday evening crash, which happened about a mile from the family’s home, that her son had been shot, and they rushed to help.

“She pulled up his shirt, (and) he had a gunshot wound to his chest,’” said neighbor Heath Charnovic, who ran inside his home to grab some towels. “All I could think to do was put pressure on his back and front.”

The woman was treated for unspecified injuries from the wreck, and the boy remains hospitalized.

Carlton is married to the boy’s mother, whose name was not released.





The shooting remains under investigation.
