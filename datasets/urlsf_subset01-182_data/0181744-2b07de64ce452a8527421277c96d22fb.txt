i have to admit, i am not a huge fan of lemon flavored food. but i wanted to branch past the limitations i seemed to be giving my taste buds and try something new. i know that lemon is a great pair with basil, so while brainstorming this recipe in walmart, i grabbed some fresh basil and a lemon. i knew i wanted to add some cream to the dish, but i forgot to buy some heavy cream at the store. oh well. anyway, while looking through the fridge, i saw the sour cream staring me in the face. it worked wonderfully! the sauce was delicious. i glanced over at the hubby at one point, and he was drinking the sauce with a spoon. i knew it was a hit. ðŸ™‚
