Poha is definitely a star breakfast option! Delicious, easy to make and full of health!

Matar poha which is made with fresh peas is an ideal and healthy breakfast or snack. This is one breakfast option which is perfect for the kiddie snack box as well.

I love a good breakfast and I am often cranky when I donâ€™t get one. I can miss any meal of the day, but breakfast is one meal I definitely have to have! And Poha is one of the easiest and yummiest breakfast options at home. Combined with boiled eggs on the side, it forms the perfect balanced kick start to the day.

In winter, with the delightful fresh peas (you can use frozen peas when fresh are not available) you can take the poha to the next level. It is perfect for the kiddie snack box as well. Adding fresh green peas to it not only adds to the taste, it also adds to the prettiness of the dish! A dash of lime and some nylon sev to top it up, and you have a breakfast option which no one can resist!

If you go to Mumbai, you will find people sending poha near the bus stops and office areas and loads of people digging into a delightful bowl of poha topped with coriander leaves, some sev and a sprinkling of grated coconut! This is a wholesome breakfast option and if you add some vegetables to it, it is a perfect meal in itself! I have friends who even have poha for dinner because it is so wholesome!

To think about it, traditional breakfast options are really wholesome. Whether it is the upma or simple paranthas with some vegetables in it (like this delicious cabbage and methi one!), each breakfast is full of health, taste and deliciousness!
