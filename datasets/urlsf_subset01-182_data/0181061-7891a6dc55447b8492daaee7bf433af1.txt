Hyundai has entered into an agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) to resolve the government’s investigation of its 2012 restatement of fuel economy ratings. This settlement does not have any impact on Hyundai customers.

The Backstory

On November 2, 2012, Hyundai announced the voluntary adjustment of fuel economy ratings for approximately one-quarter of our 2011-13 model year vehicles, reducing their combined city/highway fuel economy by 1-2 miles per gallon (mpg), and relabeled affected vehicles still in dealer showrooms. In order to compensate affected customers, Hyundai provided a lifetime reimbursement program to cover the additional fuel costs associated with the rating change plus a 15 percent premium in acknowledgement of the inconvenience. The majority of customers affected by the ratings restatement enrolled in the automaker’s reimbursement program and are being compensated based on their actual mileage and the fuel costs for the region in which they live.

Leaders in Fuel Economy

It’s important to note that even with our adjusted fuel economy ratings, Hyundai continues to lead the automotive industry in fuel efficiency and environmental performance. According to the EPA Fuel Economy Trends Report, Hyundai’s adjusted fuel ratings are 27.2 mpg for 2011, 28.3 mpg for 2012 and 29.0 mpg for 2013 model year vehicles. In addition, the Union of Concerned Scientists recently named Hyundai the “Greenest Automaker” for the 2013 model year based on emissions of nitrogen oxide, non-methane organic gas and CO2.
