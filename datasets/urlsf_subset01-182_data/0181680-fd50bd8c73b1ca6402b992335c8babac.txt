A photo of a yet to be assembled retail box for the iPhone 6s Plus has allegedly been leaked online.



The box features what appears to be a yellow and black or gold and black butterfly koi fish on the front of the iPhone's display. The image which sits on a white background looks similar to some of the wallpapers included with iOS 9. Unfortunately, the clarity of the picture makes it hard to determine if the leak is legitimate.



In addition to the picture of the box, cnbeta claims that the battery in the iPhone 6s Plus will be 2750mAh, that's smaller than the current iPhone 6 Plus battery which is 2910mAh. Of course, Apple may have improved the power consumption of its next generation smartphone so a smaller battery may not translate to less battery life.



Apple today announced a media event on September 9th at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium at which it's expected to unveil the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.
