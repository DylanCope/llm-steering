Toluca have been fined for taping a San Jose Earthquakes training session ahead of the teams’ meeting in the second leg of a CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinals matchup, the governing body of North American soccer announced Tuesday.

The confederation’s Disciplinary Committee rendered a $5,000 fine against the Liga MX side for infringement of the CONCACAF Champions League team media guidelines and breach of the FIFA Disciplinary Code for “unsporting behavior and Fair Play.”

The disciplinary action came as a result from a complaint brought by the Earthquakes claiming that a Toluca-employed cameraman allegedly filmed San Jose's final practice on March 18 at Estadio Nemesio Díez, a day ahead of their CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinal second leg, which the Quakes and Toluca drew 1-1, with the hosts advancing after winning a penalty shootout 5-4.

The Disciplinary Committee cited Article 6 of the CONCACAF Champions League Regulations and three articles of the FIFA Disciplinary Code in rendering the penalty.

In accordance with art. 6.5 of the CONCACAF Champions League Regulations, the present decision is not subject to appeal.
