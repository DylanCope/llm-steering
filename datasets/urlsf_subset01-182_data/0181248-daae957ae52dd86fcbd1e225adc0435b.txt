In 1887 multiple quarries were created around the small village in the north of Saxony. The area had previously made its living through a modest agricultural industry, growing sugar beets.

The removal of stone slowly allowed for the extension of a rocky cleft into what he - the false prophet - knew in its ideal state to be a flat, green, oval disk of water, surrounded by abrupt walls of torn rock.

The quarry still connects to the village via a small dirt road. The muddy strip intersects equally muddy rectangular fields that surround the small

Gemeinde. --

He enjoyed the confusion of the secular [municipality] and sacred [congregation] realms that the German word proposed.

--- The road transitions into a smaller path which moves fairly straight towards the rock formations. The sharp ridges are surrounded by a wooded area of only moderate density. The formations themselves reaching the size of two, three men at most - abruptly intersecting the otherwise smoothly rising and falling landscape of the region.

The positive protrusion of rocks and its transition towards a negative form [containing a body of water] revealed several uses that seemed too coherent, too repetitive to him.

Firstly, he imagined, the quarry must have - like so many others in the region - served as a place of labour and later as a site of punishment.

Secondly, after the war the local villagers had used the surprising depth of the quarry to discard old uniforms and propaganda objects.

And - thirdly - a local community of Christian believers had used it for baptism gatherings during the summer.

He remembered his own - and the baptism of another man [with the same name as his] at the quarry.

The other one had requested to be baptized, knowing that he only had a few more months to live his new life, before dying an organic death.

The experience of an otherâ€™s failing body had such an impression on his young mind, that he often struggled to remember details of his own declarative dip into the water.

A second baptism memory filled the gap: He accidentally slipped on a rock into the water, not knowing how to swim yet.

The false prophet moved towards a wooden structure at the entrance to the wooded area. Here, he decided to rename his Grand Father (Joash) and Great Grandfather (Ahaziah).
