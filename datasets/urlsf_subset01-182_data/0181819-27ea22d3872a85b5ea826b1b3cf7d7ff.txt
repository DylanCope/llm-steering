Transcript via MSNBC’s Chris Jansing:

JANSING: Let me ask you about something Donald Trump said today, because he looks more and more… SANDERS: Oh, what was it Donald Trump – now the media’s – the media – major function of media is to follow the Donald Trump quote of the day. JANSING: But more and more… SANDERS: My eating habits. JANSING: More and more it does look like he’s going to be the nominee… SANDERS: Yes. JANSING: … on the Republican side, so either you or Hillary Clinton is going to have to run against him. SANDERS: Yes, it would be my pleasure.

One of the great injustices of the 2016 campaign has been the fact that the media has ignored a great primary full of discussion of the issues on the Democratic side so that they can follow every more that Donald Trump makes.

Bernie Sanders has been a candidate of substance, but he has not gotten to talk about that substance in nearly enough depth because the press would rather talk about Donald Trump’s latest insult or tweet.

If the media is smart, they will stop asking Bernie Sanders questions about Donald Trump. Sen. Sanders may be ready to blow, and the next member of the press who asks him about Trump may not like the answer that they get.
