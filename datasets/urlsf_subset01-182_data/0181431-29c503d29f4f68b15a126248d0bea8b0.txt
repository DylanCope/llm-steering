Scouts from English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur are hot on the trail of former D.C. United winger Andy Najar and could be lining up a bid to bring to White Hart Lane next year, according to a report of out England.

The Daily Star reported on Sunday that Tottenham scouts watched Najar during Anderlecht’s UEFA Champions League matchup against Borussia Dortmund last week and were impressed, and they will watch him again when Anderlecht take on Arsenal later this month.

Najar, 21, left D.C. United to join Anderlecht in January 2013 for a reported $3 million transfer fee. He was the first MLS Homegrown player to sign for a European club, and his transfer deal to Anderlecht included a “sell-on clause,” meaning United will claim a percentage of any future transfer of Najar by Anderlecht.

Najar appeared in 25 matches in his first season in Belgium and has appeared in eight more this season, scoring two goals. He also appeared in two matches for Honduras during the World Cup this summer in Brazil.



He spent four seasons in MLS and won the league’s Rookie of the Year award in 2010.

Najar has also recently been linked to clubs in Spain as well as EPL sides Arsenal and Newcastle. He has history with Tottenham – he spent two weeks training with the club in 2011 and later said “those two weeks allowed me to experience European football and helped ease my transition to Anderlecht” – and Spurs have a history inking former and current MLS players.

Longtime United States national team goalkeeper Brad Friedel has been with the club since 2011, Clint Dempsey played there in 2012-13 and Seattle Sounders defender DeAndre Yedlin signed with Spurs earlier this year with expectations that he will join the club sometime ahead of the 2015-16 season.
