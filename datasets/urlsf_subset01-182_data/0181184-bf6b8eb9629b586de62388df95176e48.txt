Even though it’s easy enough for most of us to comprehend, there are sadly still many people out there who don’t understand the difference between rape and consent. Because of this, Twitter user Nafisa Ahmed decided to break it down in a way that everybody can understand.

“I don’t get how rape is so hard to understand for some men,” she wrote in the first of a series of tweets. “But, if you put it like this, they get it.” Ahmed then goes on to explain the difference using a super simple and effective analogy involving a purse and some money. While it’s pretty sad that she even has to do this, we’re certainly glad that she did. Let’s just hope everybody takes note.
