If you’ve read my book, Zen & The Art Of Disc Golf , you know that I place great emphasis on how having a proper attitude sets the foundation for everything in life and on the course, but If there was one thing I wish I could go back and spend more time is talking about, it is that the fastest way to develop a proper attitude is by adding a gratitude routine to your day.

Gratitude fuels attitude. When we have a gratitude mindset, the mind starts looking for ways to fulfill vision. Vision is anything we want: a good drive, sinking a putt, a promotion at work, anything!

The opposite of gratitude is thanklessness, and when w are thankless, we are programmed to only see the things we don’t have, can’t do, all sorts of negativity, and our mind becomes programmed in that direction. And where the mind goes, so does the body.

I recently read a gratitude routine that I think is probably really effective – use a jar, box, container and put it at your front door with small slivers of paper next to, and everyday before you leave your house take one of the sheets of paper and write down:

1. Something you are grateful for.

2. Something that you want.

3. The actions you will take to get there.

So an example would be:

1. I am thankful for all of this excellent plastic in my disc golf bag.

2. I would like to sink more 25 foot putts.

3. I am going to do this by practicing putting every day.

Another example might be in your life off of the course:
