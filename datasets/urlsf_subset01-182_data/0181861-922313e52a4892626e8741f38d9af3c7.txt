A judge has revoked the bond of a university of Alabama fan accused of poisoning Auburn University's landmark oak trees.

Officers hand-cuffed Harvey Updyke and took him to jail after the ruling Wednesday by Circuit Judge Jacob A. Walker III in Opelika.

Walker granted prosecutors' request to jail Updyke after watching a video of his arrest after a confrontation with store employees at a Louisiana home improvement store in September.

The defense argued that Updyke should remain free because the arrest was improper.

The judge said Updyke violated terms of his bond by getting arrested and notes that Louisiana still has an arrest warrant for him.

Updyke is set for trial April 8 on charges that include criminal mischief.

The university says the trees are all but dead and will be removed.
