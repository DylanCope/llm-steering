Aroldis Chapman described the amount of discomfort in the left elbow as minor, but it was enough for the Yankees to stuff the former closer into an MRI exam tube Sunday.

“There was a little bit of discomfort. It was precautionary and they decided to do a test,’’ Chapman told The Post through an interpreter after the Indians topped the Yankees, 6-2, Monday night at Yankee Stadium. “It’s 100 percent fine.’’

Removed from the closer’s role last weekend in Boston after giving up two runs and two hits in one inning of a 9-6 loss on Aug. 18, Chapman made three appearances. The most recent was Friday night when he gave up a game-winning homer to Yonder Alonso of the Mariners in the 11th inning. It was the second homer he allowed to a left-handed hitter this season after previously giving up just one in his entire career.

Chapman was available Monday night but not used.

“Of course it’s good news,’’ Chapman said of the clear MRI. “In my mind there was no doubt I was fine.’’

The first season of a five-year, $86 million contract the Yankees gave the 29-year-old Chapman last December hasn’t gone well. In addition to being removed from the prestigious closer’s role Chapman went on the disabled list May 14 with an inflamed left rotator cuff. He returned June 18. In 41 games Chapman is 4-3 with a 4.23 ERA and 16 saves in 20 chances.
