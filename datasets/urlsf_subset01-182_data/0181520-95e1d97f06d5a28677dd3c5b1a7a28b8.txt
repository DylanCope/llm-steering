Public fountains are dry in Barcelona, Spain, a city so parched thereâ€™s a â‚¬9,000 ($13,000) fine if youâ€™re caught watering your flowers. A tanker ship docked there this month carrying 5 million gallons of precious fresh water â€“ and officials are scrambling to line up more such shipments to slake public thirst.

Barcelona is not alone. Cyprus will ferry water from Greece this summer. Australian cities are buying water from that nationâ€™s farmers and building desalination plants. Thirsty China plans to divert Himalayan water. And 18 million southern Californians are bracing for their first water-rationing in years.

Water, Dow Chemical Chairman Andrew Liveris told the World Economic Forum in February, â€œis the oil of this century.â€ Developed nations have taken cheap, abundant fresh water largely for granted. Now global population growth, pollution, and climate change are shaping a new view of water as â€œblue gold.â€

Waterâ€™s hot-commodity status has snared the attention of big equipment suppliers like General Electric as well as big private water companies that buy or manage municipal supplies â€“ notably France-based Suez and Aqua America, the largest US-based private water company.

Global water markets, including drinking water distribution, management, waste treatment, and agriculture are a nearly $500 billion market and growing fast, says a 2007 global investment report.

But governments pushing to privatize costly to maintain public water systems are colliding with a global â€œwater is a human rightâ€ movement. Because water is essential for human life, its distribution is best left to more publicly accountable government authorities to distribute at prices the poorest can afford, those water warriors say.

â€œWeâ€™re at a transition point where fundamental decisions need to be made by societies about how this basic human need â€“ water â€“ is going to be provided,â€ says Christopher Kilian, clean-water program director for the Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation. â€œThe profit motive and basic human need [for water] are just inherently in conflict.â€

Will â€œpeak waterâ€ displace â€œpeak oilâ€ as the central resource question? Some see such a scenario rising.

â€œWhatâ€™s different now is that itâ€™s increasingly obvious that weâ€™re running up against limits to new [fresh water] supplies,â€ says Peter Gleick, a watÂ­Â­Â­er expert and president of the Pacific InÂ­Â­Â­stiÂ­Â­tute for Studies in Development, EnÂ­Â­viÂ­Â­Â­ronÂ­Â­ment, and SecÂ­Â­urÂ­Â­ity, a nonpartisan think tank in OakÂ­land, Calif. â€œItâ€™s no longÂ­Â­er cheap and easy to drill another well or dam another river.â€
