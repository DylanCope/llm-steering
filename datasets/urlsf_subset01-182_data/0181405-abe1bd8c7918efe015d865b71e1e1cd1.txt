Japanese camera brand Yashica is on the verge of a comeback. While the brand has long been a favorite amongst photographers — with the T4 edition gaining special notoriety amongst those who wanted handheld point-and-shoot versatility with a Zeiss lens — it has fallen from commercial popularity over the years.

The company — founded back in 1949 in Nagano, Japan as a manufacturer of clock components — made its first camera in 1953 and, if the teaser is to believed, now aims to bring back some of its most-loved cameras. The video, entitled “The Silence of Story,” is a triptych of short clips showcasing a photographer on her travels and ending with “look out for a coming chapter.” There’s no news as to which cameras will be part of the revamp, but you can take a guess based on which models appear in the film above.

You can register your interest over at the Yashica website, and — in other photography news — why not check out this behind-the-scenes production footage of the Leica M10.
