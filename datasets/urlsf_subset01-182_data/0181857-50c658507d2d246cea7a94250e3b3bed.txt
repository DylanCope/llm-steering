If the UFC owners are selling their company, acquiring cash to invest in an NFL team is not the reason.

At least not right now.

UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta declined comment about the accuracy of recent reports that the world’s largest mixed martial arts organization is on the verge of being sold for more than $4 billion.

He did say there is no current plan to be involved in bringing the Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas, at least on an ownership level.

“Well, I would never say never,” Fertitta said of his interest in NFL ownership. “We’re certainly not involved at this point.”

Fertitta, whose two sons play college football, says he has “an incredible love for the sport.”

The biggest obstacle to NFL ownership would be his stake in Station Casinos.

“Historically, and that’s not to say things can’t change, but historically, there’s been kind of a bit of a, I don’t think ban is the right word, but having an ownership or association in casinos, especially where you’re taking sports bets, has not been allowed,” Fertitta said. “That’s a major stumbling block for me at this point.”
