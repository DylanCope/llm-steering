It’s no secret that we’re big fans of the fashion on Pretty Little Liars, and soon it may be even easier to snag a look inspired by Aria, Hanna, Spencer, and Emily. Entertainment Weekly is reporting that retailer Aeropostale will be releasing a PLL-themed clothing line next month.

Aeropostale worked with Pretty Little Liars costume designer Mandi Line to create the line, which will include items inspired by each character’s individual style. The collection will be priced between $18 and $72.

The Pretty Little Liars Collection by Aeropostale will be available in stores and online starting on January 5, which will coincide with the show’s winter premiere on ABC Family January 7.
