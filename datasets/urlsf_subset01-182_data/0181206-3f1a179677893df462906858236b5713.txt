Newcomer Specials

Let’s start first with newcomer specials. It’s actually quite common today in the online gambling biz to entice newcomers with exclusive offers so that they sign-up and use their platform. The reason is actually pretty simple–with some massive range of games and platforms, the competition is stiff and sites should better offer newcomers reasons to try the out. William Hill doesn’t disappoint at all in this regard. If you desire to try out tennis betting for example, the same special runs but in this case, you’ll be able to receive £30 worth of betting bonus for every £10 stake you add and after using the code C30. The same special code applies to most games on the platform available for betting. Some exclusions may apply. In soccer betting, for instance, you’ll get only £20 as a free staking bonus for every £10 you stake. Many of the separate games on the site also carry some fabulous offers with them and we suggest that you view them yourself.

Bonus rules

For the purpose of using the site-wide C30 bonus code, we are now listing all the terms that come with it. You can also view these directly in detail from their main website. So anyone seeking to take advantage of this promo special, will need to place an original deposit of £10 or more.

FAQS

It’s natural for newcomers on the site to have some questions and as third party reviewers, we had some questions as well. Perhaps the No 1 question users have is about the legitimacy of the platform. With so many online scams out there, it’s natural to feel suspicious of gambling platforms like this. But since William Hill has been a big and trusty name in the biz, there is nothing to worry about. The platform is fully licensed and maintains strong security measures that preserve the safety of the users. Users can add and withdraw money safely in just a few seconds so there is no reason to be worried.

This current special is open for both newcomers and existing clients as opposed to the previous welcome code.

Why we like the Will Hill Casino area

How to get additional points.

Now you can collect Comp points (Complimentary points) at Will Hill casino every time you bet with your real cash. The more games and money you stake, the more comp points you are going to grab.

Every £10 you stake is equal to one comp point. There is no limit in the points you can collect, however, different casino games contribute to different amounts of points. For example some games come with double comp points and you better check these out. The exchange rates may change on occasion. This is what actually makes them different from the competition.

How to claim and swap golde chips for real cash stakes

As a newbie at William Hill Casino, you can swap golden chips for real cash stakes to play on other eligible games. Golden chips are available in the casino section of the site once you sign in your account.

It is also possible to reveal all the eligible games with golden chips from the same area. All users that fit given requirements for claiming golden chips will receive important notifications in the bottom section whilst playing their chosen game.

The moment you claim your golden chips is the moment you can start using them as well. However, you can only spare these chips during the start of the game you’ve chosen.

Games included in the eligible list are: Live and Premium Roulette Pro versions, Euro Roulette, Baccarat, and French Roulette.

Keep in mind that funds used with golden chips are not actually realy cash. You have to rollover your funds 40X at least before you can cash out.

Will Hill VIP programs

William Hill Players can now get their hands in a hot VIP special every time they tell their friends to join the VIP program. A few of the privileges they can get include specials, bonuses, discounts and higher comp points collected through eligible games.

The VIP program level you are placed depends on how many real cash you spare and how often you use the platform.

Therefore, if someone wants to be a part of this reward scheme they have to fulfill all the VIP membership criteria. As soon as the system confirms the eligibility of the client, they will be given an e-mail notification with a link to participate in their reward scheme.

If the player manages to collect a certain number of points, they will be upgraded to a higher level with more privileges.

The exchange amounts for comp points vary according to your VIP membership level. For example, if you are a bronze VIP member, the exchange rate is 95 comp points for 1 dollar or pound. For Silver level members the amount is 30 comp points per 1 dollar or pound and lastly for platinum gold members, the exchange rate is set to 80 points per 1 dollar or pound.

Every time the players uses golden chips they also get a bonus. You will know as soon you get these golden chips specials and use them progressively when opting to play a game.

Here is a nice and clear example that shows how golden chip staking works: Let’s say that the user signs-in to their casino account. As soon as they head to the mobile area of their account, they can see a list of all eligible games they can use with their golden chip bonus. The client uses these towards the start of each game and they grab £30. Since the rollover requirement is 40X, the player must spare £1200 in total to cash out.

Referral specials

In case you are an existing player and you invite a friend to join, you can get max. £50 in the form of bonuses. Your friend though must sign in and add their first deposit on their account’s wallet to get your bonus.

There is no actual limit to the number of friends you can invite, unlike other similar programs. As long as the other person you invite opens an account and add their first deposit on the casino, you can redeem the £50 bonus.

For those that wish to join the referral program, one of the main requirements is to install the software app supplied by the casino for referrals and the referral link that invites your friend to join.

The friend that wishes to join should follow carefully all the required steps revealed to them by e-mail.

To fully redeem the bonus, your joining friend should add a minimum of £50 and stake another £50 at least.

After redeeming the bonus, you should rollover this 15X to be able to make a withdrawal.

Here is a good example: John is an existing player at William Hill. Once he gets the required referral link, he forwards it to his friend Jack-Jack uses the link and implements all the required steps given to him by e-mail starting from opening his own account. He then goes ahead and add his first cash deposit of £20. He chooses a game and uses his funds. John and Jack will now get a £20 on their accounts as a bonus. For cashing out their profits, they have to separately rollover X15 their bonus funds which is (£300). You don’t have to use any other promo code once you have been referred by a friend. See this video powered by William Hill Casino to see the bonus and casino areas in action.

Other promotional codes and welcome specials

Apart from the official William Hill casino lobby, new players can reap other extra bonus in other game sections like Bingo and Poker, for example:

The existing promo is 400% bonus on top for amounts max. £40 for newcomer bingo players. The bonus is split like that: £30 is granted as Bingo Bonus and £10 as bonus amount for games.

Poker games.Enter the code WHP2000 to land a £10 free to play.

Our verdict

Quality-wise the platform has nothing to envy from other big players in the biz and William Hill is renowned for its quality platform. Numerous gaming options are available at a player’s fingertips like for example football, tennis, cricket, basketball, and others.

And the best part, a no-fuss gaming experience is guaranteed. It literally just takes a few minutes to sign-up and start gambling.

Functionality of games & bets

The site has one of the top betting functionality system you can find out there (also known as ergonomics). This refers to the level of system responsiveness to player needs and where the player wishes to head to. The system is smart and interactive and the level of platform is on pretty high standards. But that doesn’t come across as a surprise. Will Hill is definitely one of the top names in the online betting era with millions of profits and fans out there–imagine if all this was translated into a faulty and dysfunctional design system that just look amateurish. Overall, we are talking about a solid platform that really pays attention to user experience and stats.

Now going back to the topic of odds, the levels are pretty much similar to what you’ll experience in most other websites. But, if you take advantage of their special promos, you can maximize the value of your funds for bigger wins. These specials run almost every day so stay tuned and keep your eyes open for new and more exciting specials that fit your gaming type and category.

Their customer support team is also excellent but as we have stated numerous times before, this is what you get when you are dealing with the top 5 names on the biz. The platforms offers a 24-hour customer support service and real agents are ready to cater to your queries and issues when you need them. The average response time is pretty prompt so you can rest assured that your query will be handled as quickly as possible. Now, that’s not to say that everyone is satisfied with their customer service–just like almost any company, there are a few complaints that the customer service is not that helpful. But that’s only a small minority as most users of the platform agree that their customer service is great overall.

Funding methods-adding funds and withdrawals

The wide availability of banking options is another reason to use the site with no worries. There are actually more than 6 different funding options to add and withdraw your earnings.These include of course common credit cards like Visa and Mastercard, Maestro, Paypal, Neteller, Skrill, Nordea and others. You can simply add funds instantly in a few seconds if you choose a digital payment method. However, less direct and conventional methods like for example bank wires may require anywhere from 2-10 days prior cashing out. The highest amount you can add with a single transaction is $100K via a bank check.You can also add a max of $99.999 via common funding options like Visa/Visa Electron, Maestro, and Mastercard. For Paypal transactions, the highest amount you can bet per transaction is $5K. The good thing is, no matter what funding option you use, there are no transaction fees like on other websites.

Customer service info

Should you wish to reach them out for any query or issue with your account or the platform in general, you can hit their free UK landline: 0800 085 6295 or their global free line at: 00800 3551 355 and your query will be handled as promptly as possible. If you wish to reach them out via another method besides the phone, you can also do so through e-mail at [email protected] You may not get an instant response but your query will be addressed fast enough.

Mobile site & app

Besides the main version available for P.C users, the platform also has a dedicated Android and mobile app. Therefore, mobile and android users won’t struggle to use the platform. On top of that, Android users also have access to special bonuses just for them. The basic features that appear on the main version are also available on mobile. You can use the platform with ease, nothing will appear weird. Mobile users can also take advantage of their exclusive horse racing special. The only steps that you have to do, of course, is to download and save the app on your smartphone or android. It takes only a few minutes and it’s really worth your time as things will get easier afterwards.

Final Verdict

If you ask us, we believe that William Hill really lives up to its robust name in the biz of gambling. With so many competitors, things can get hard but Will Hill still manages to stay among the top. And if there is something that you aren’t keen on at this platform, there are a few similar alternatives to bet on. But since their sportsbook betting products and bets are excellent, they really make a good choice for sports gamblers.

William Hill is a brand that’s truly made themselves climb among the top in the biz. Their non-stop dedication and devotion to offering their users a top-notch gaming experience makes them one of the highest ranking betting platforms you can find out there–covering both sports enthusiasts and casino fans.

Top 3 competing sites

As there are a few other sites with very similar design and betting products, it would be noteworthy to mention what its 3 top main competitors are. The no1 is probably Bet365, which is another big player (if not the biggest) in the betting biz. One thing that makes Bet365 a step ahead of others and William Hill, in this case, is its smart, simple, and hassle-free layout offering a really great user experience.

Another good alternative site is Ladbrokes. We particularly like that they offer a welcome special for £20 if you stake just £5 in the form of free stakes. Due to its quality and simple layout, you’ll find this a tad easier to use comparing to the William Hill website. The level of stakes ranks similar to the ones you can find on William Hill. Overall, using the Ladbroke platform is a breeze.We also like how easy it is to add funds and cash out as you wish.

Last but not least, another option you can try out that’s on par with the previously mentioned betting platforms is Betfred. Betfred is a very popular name in the UK gambling biz and even globally, over the last few years. They currently run a special for welcoming new users: a £30 extra for an original deposit of £10.You can take advantage of all their special bonuses after opening new accounts and adding your first funds without any restrictions. Plus, they boast one of the best stakes in the online betting market and so we suggest that you chew them out.
