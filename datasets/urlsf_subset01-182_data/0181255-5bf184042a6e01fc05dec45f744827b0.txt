MANILA - Fewer Filipinos are getting married, the latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed.

"In a span of 10 years, the reported marriages decreased by 20.1 percent from 2005 to 2015," according to the recently released report.

PSA said that according to data on marriages, mostly obtained from the Certificates of Marriage at Civil Registrars throughout the country, there has been a "continuous decline" in marriages. It however did not cite reasons for the decreasing numbers.

"It is interesting to note that from that year up to 2015, the number of marriages declined continuously. Registered marriages declined by 2.9 percent in 2014 and 3.6 percent in 2015," PSA said in its study.

As of 2015, around 1,135 couples get married each day. At least 42 percent of couples tied the knot via civil wedding, while 36 percent said their "I do's" during Roman Catholic ceremonies.

PSA said that of the 1,135 weddings happening everyday in 2015, 14 percent are held in the National Capital Region, 13 percent in Calabarzon, and 11 percent in Central Luzon.

"These regions were consistently in the top three for the past five years in the same order," the report said.
