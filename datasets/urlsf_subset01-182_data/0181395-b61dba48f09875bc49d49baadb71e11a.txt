ST MIRREN are to welcome English opposition to their new stadium for the first time when they host Barclays Premier League outfit Newcastle in a pre-season friendly.

The Magpies will send a side made up of youth and first-team players to St Mirren Park for the warm-up clash on Tuesday, July 30.

The side will be taken by under-21 boss and former Scotland international Willie Donachie and could see the return of Paul Dummett and Conor Newton to Paisley, after both helped the Buddies lift the Scottish Communities League Cup during loan stints last season.

Saints' new Â£15million home was opened in January 2009 following their departure from Love Street, but only near neighbours Morton have visited outside of competitive play.

Allan Moore's side are due to return to Paisley, however, for the Renfrewshire Cup final on Saturday, July 20, after St Mirren announced their pre-season plans.

Boss Danny Lennon has also confirmed that the Clydesdale Bank Premier League side will face npower Championship outfit Charlton Athletic on Saturday, July 13, during a warm-weather camp in Spain.

League Two side Morecambe will then welcome the Scots to The Globe Arena on Wednesday, July 24, before they prepare for the visit of Newcastle by facing Blue Square Bet Conference North side Stockport County on Saturday, July 27, at Edgeley Park.

The Newcastle friendly will be Saints' last pre-season outing before the new SPL season kicks off four days later.
