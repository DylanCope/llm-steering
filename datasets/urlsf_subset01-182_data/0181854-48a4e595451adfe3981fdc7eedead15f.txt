Whatever productivity tips and tricks you try, you’ll probably find you’re never able to rid yourself of the to-do list. While it would be great if you could complete every task immediately, it’s usually not possible. If you’re anything like me, you end up with a million and one things on your list and no idea how to get through them.

Mark Forster’s SuperFocus method aims to help you get better control over your to-do list and stop important items from getting lost or forgotten.

This workplace hack involves writing your to-do list with a good old fashioned pen and paper. Split your page into 2 columns. In the left column (column 1), write your entire to-do list. Now take a good look at your list and move the most urgent items to the right column (column 2).

When you complete a task, delete it from your list. Recurring tasks should be re-entered at the bottom of column 1. If you start a task and don’t complete it, erase it from column 1 and add it to column 2 with your urgent items.

Continue circulating around the page until you feel that all tasks are complete. Before you start a new page, you don’t need to complete all tasks in column 1, but you do need to complete everything in column 2. When you get to the end of your list, go back to the beginning and start again.
