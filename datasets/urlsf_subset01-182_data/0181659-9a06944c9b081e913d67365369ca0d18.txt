The Coroner ruled there was no foul play in Bruce Mouat's death, but five years later a woman has pleaded not guilty to his manslaughter.

On Tuesday Susan Elizabeth Mouat appeared via audio visual link in the High Court at New Plymouth, charged with the manslaughter of 48-year-old Bruce Mouat in his Hawera home in July, 2011.

She entered a plea of not guilty and was remanded on bail by Justice Simon France until September 4, 2017 for a trial by jury.

She was charged with the manslaughter five years after a coroner agreed with police findings that there was no foul play in the death.

In his findings released in February 2012 coroner Tim Scott found that Mouat, a mountaineer and leader of the Taranaki Alpine and Cliff Rescue team, died of a blunt force head injury after falling down five concrete steps outside the front door and hitting his head on a concrete paver at the bottom.

Mouat was taken to Hawera Hospital then transferred to Taranaki Hospital. About 2pm on July 16 he was flown to Wellington Hospital, where he remained until his death on July 27.

On Tuesday interim name suppression for Susan Elizabeth Mouat lapsed and was not re-applied for.
