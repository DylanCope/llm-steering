The days of endless marketing spam are finally coming to an end. ITworld reports that Google is finally ready to roll out its handy unsubscribe button, a link appearing at the top of any promotional email which will prompt your Gmail account to automatically send a message to the sender and request your removal from the list of recipients. The additional link should streamline a tedious process which has plagued email users for years. Google believes that with the unsubscribe link prominently displayed at the top of the email, users will refrain from marking every unwanted message as spam. When a sender is repeatedly sent to the spam folder of hundreds of recipients, Google begins to take notice, and the offending business could be penalized. In the end, the new tool could be a win for both marketers and consumers.
