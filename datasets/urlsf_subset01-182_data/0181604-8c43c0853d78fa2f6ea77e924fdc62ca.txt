Timothy Fosu-Mensah insists Jose Mourinho has 'faith' in him and has no complaints about his current situation at Manchester United.

Fosu-Mensah, 18, was not named on the United teamsheet for any of their four August fixtures but was included in Mourinho's 26-man senior squad and is expected to feature in a busier September.

The Dutchman impressed in the majority of his 10 appearances last season and stressed he has little to complain about at United under his new manager.

"It's going well," Fosu-Mensah, who is on international duty with the Under-21s, told Fox Sports Netherlands. "I am fit and do not have much to complain about.

"I have not played much, but train with the first-team and do everything with the first-team. I want to fight myself into the base.

"I talk to Jose Mourinho about my development, which is going well. Mourinho has faith in me, so he keeps me in the selection."

Fosu-Mensah also spoke effusively about training with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a teammate almost twice his age.

"It is a dream come true for boys, yes," Fosu-Mensah responded when asked what it was like to train with former Ajax striker Ibrahimovic.

"Training with Zlatan is very special and you learn a lot. After [training] you see how he takes free-kicks and how he finishes, then you see what a top player he is.

"If you face him, you can also learn a lot from him. You are extra sharp as you train against him and so you don't look ridiculous."
