Two late goals in three minutes helped AFC Wimbledon end their four game losing run with victory at play-off chasing Newport County.

The Exiles took a second half lead through a Ross Worner own goal when the Dons' keeper let a long ball slip through his hands.

Wimbledon striker Charlie Sheringham equalised with a shot from close range.

Kevin Sainte-Luce struck the winner high into the goal to condemn County to their second home defeat in a row.

VIEWS FROM THE DRESSING ROOM

Newport County manager Justin Edinburgh told BBC Radio Wales:

"Wimbledon probably deserved to win the game. For the standards that we've set we're not quite reaching them right now.

"We prepared correctly, as we do every game. We didn't make the most of the opportunities given to us and we're going to regret that.

"We've got another tough game here on Saturday and we're certainly going to have to play a lot better than we have done."
