LONDON — Britain's defense secretary has confirmed that MBDA UK has secured a £30 million (US $40 million) deal to build a laser-directed energy weapon demonstrator.





The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is finalizing the deal with the UK arm of Europe's major missile maker to build a one-off prototype laser weapon, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told an audience of industry executives, allies and others at an event in London on Friday to launch a new innovation initiative. MBDA won the competition being run by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory to build the demonstrator several months ago, but the announcement was held up after rival bidder Thales UK lodged a protest against the decision.





The grounds for the protest, or the fact the protest had been lodged, were never made public. The Thales protest was recently rejected, leaving the way open for Fallon to make the announcement.
