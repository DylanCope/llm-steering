Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve and Susan W. Tanner, Young Women General President, present two powerful messages on self-image and society's obsession with outward appearance. Based on their October 2005 General Conference addresses, this small-size volume explores the intimate link between body, mind, and spirit. Women of all ages are confronted with fixation on the physical body. This has become increasingly common in the world today. Elder Holland asserts, “You are bombarded in movies, television, fashion magazines, and advertisements with the message that looks are everything! The pitch is, 'If your looks are good enough, your life will be glamorous and you will be happy and popular.' That kind of pressure is immense in the teenage years to say nothing of later womanhood.” These timely and inspired messages will help us to understand that happiness comes from accepting and enhancing our natural attributes, not from remaking our bodies after the image of the world.
