Australian A-League club Central Coast Mariners could make a move to sign Croatia international stalwart Ivica Olić…



Reports in the media suggest that the Australian club, which is based in Gosford, on the Central Coast of New South Wales, may sign the 36-year-old former Bayern Munich striker on a 1-year deal. The Daily Telegraph says that Olić’s agents have made it clear that the player is interested in playing in the A-League.

Olić needs to be playing football if he wants to figure in Croatia coach Ante Čačić’s plans for Euro 2016 in France, and with media reporting that Olić’s German club HSV have told him that he is a free agent, the option to join the Australian club may be a tempting one, although he will be far away from the eye of the manager.

Olić was quoted before Christmas as saying that he was ‘90% certain’ that he would leave Hamburg after the winter break. The experienced striker, who has represented Croatia 104 times, is keen to make Euro 2016 his farewell tournament.
