Holy cow, I really got spoiled by my Santa! A big and heavy box came and I could hardly wait to open it. Santa messaged me to ask if there were any specific things I was hoping to add to our camping gear, and I mentioned needing some new pots and pans. Lo and behold, the big box contained a complete cookware set!! And it's the ceramic lined stuff that doesn't stick, which makes outdoor cleanup sooooo much easier.

Then yesterday, ANOTHER box comes, and in it is the most gorgeous book of European cycling trips. The included not said that it was for my Bucket List item (a cycling trip in Europe), and apologized for it not being plane tickets. Hey, I'm already drooling over some of the trips and the photography is stunning. I can't wait to cross this item off my list, and now I have lots of ideas!

So I can stay local and use the cookware, or go international and cycle through Europe. Such choices!! Thanks, Santa, you are awesome!!!
