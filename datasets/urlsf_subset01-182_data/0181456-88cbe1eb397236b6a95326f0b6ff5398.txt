Roll the dough into a long log, and refrigerate till firm, I always make mine the night before and start off in the morning after they are really firm. Easier to slice and keep their shape.





1 stick (1/2 cup) butter softened

1 cup confectionery sugar

2 teaspoons lemon extract plus 1/2 teaspoon of lemon rind finely grated

1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

2 cups flour

1 tablespoon cornstarch

1/4 teaspoon salt

8 tablespoons of heavy cream

more confectionery sugar for rolling the cookies in after cooked



In a large bowl, cream together the butter and confectionersâ€™ sugar until smooth. Beat in lemon extract, vanilla extract. Add flour, cornstarch, and salt, mixing with the mixer on low speed to keep the flour from flying. Add in 8 tablespoons heavy cream and beat until mixture just comes together. Dough will be a firm ball. Roll into a smooth log on wax paper using this also to wrap to refrigerator for at least an hour or overnight.

Preheat oven to 350F. Place on ungreased cookie sheets or on parchment paper

Slice dough long way down the middle evenly to split in half. By laying them down on the flat sides to cut, you will get the half moon effect shape of these cookies. Slice at least 1/4 inch thick, they will be crunchier and buttery when cooked, if you want a softer cookie, slice thicker and cook only 8 minutes till set. Place on cookie sheets, cookies won't spread much. Bake for 10 minutes, or until edges are brown.

While still hot place confectionery sugar in a deep bowl and mix cookies into it. When cookies are cool, take a large plastic bag, add more sugar and shake cookies again to evenly coat.
