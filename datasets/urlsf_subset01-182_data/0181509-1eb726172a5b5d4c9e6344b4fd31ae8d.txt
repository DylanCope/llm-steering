Another U.S. legend is set to take the touchline for the national team program.

Sources tell EoS that former Tottenham goalkeeper and USMNT mainstay Brad Friedel will assume the role as coach of the newly minted U.S. U-19 program.

Friedel, 44, appeared in 80 matches with the U.S. National Team, earning his way to three World Cup rosters. He is the fourth most capped goalkeeper in American history. His illustrious 19 year Premiership career includes stints with Liverpool, Tottenham, Aston Villa and Blackburn. He currently holds the league record for most consecutive starts with 310.

In his post-playing career, Friedel has featured with both BBC and FOX as a television commentator. He will continue to serve in his role with FOX as he assumes the reins of the USMNT U-19 program.

Like former teammates Clint Mathis and Tony Meola before him, Friedel has volunteered time with Tab Ramos at the U-20 level, lending his experience to the youth side. This role as U-19 coach, however, will be his first professional coaching role of any capacity.

An announcement should be made by U.S. Soccer in the coming days.
