Refuse Fascism, an organization which appears regularly with Antifa at protests, has announced they will hold a mass protest against Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro when he speaks September 14 at the University of California, Berkeley. They are circulating a flyer accusing Shapiro of being a white supremacist, a misogynist, xenophobic, and intellectually fascist.

The accusations are hilariously out of touch with reality; Shapiro was the number one target of anti-Semitism on Twitter in 2016, mostly from white supremacists; he has vehemently denounced the KKK and white supremacists time after time; he is accused of being a misogynist because he is staunchly pro-life, and thus is protecting all those little female babies the feminist-obsessed Left ignores as they champion abortion; xenophobic is ridiculous considering he has said repeatedly that he would be happy to trade ten million immigrants who would come to America and work hard to achieve the American Dream over ten million people who simply want a hand-out from the government; and intellectually fascist is ludicrous as he always says before any Q&A that he wants leftists to go to the head of the line so they can discuss their differences.
