A new poll out Tuesday morning finds Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell even with one of his potential Democratic challengers.

The poll, conducted by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling for Senate Majority PAC, found McConnell and Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes tied at 45 percent with 10 percent undecided.

Grimes, Democrats’ top prospect to take on McConnell, is still an unknown quantity to almost half the state’s voters. Her approval rating in the poll is 34 percent, compared with 24 percent who disapprove — but 42 percent didn’t have an opinion of her.

The would-be candidate met with Kentucky Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear last month to discuss the race but is still mulling whether to jump in.

Rep. John Yarmouth (D-Ky.) called on Grimes to make her decision, saying Tuesday that further delay hurts other Democrats who might get in if she doesn’t.

“I do think that it is important that Alison Grimes immediately decide whether she’s running or not because there are a number of people sitting on the sidelines who would be interested I think in making a race who are waiting to find out what she does,” he told the Kentucky radio station WFPL. “And for her to keep prolonging this as she said possibly until the late summer I think is a disservice to the party.”
