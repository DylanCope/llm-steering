UPDATE, 7:30 p.m.: Soooo, did players actually vomit after seeing Bridgewater's injury? Rapoport now says no:

I said this. But what I meant was they were noticeably affected. Regrettably, it was not meant literally. https://t.co/DDv2zWeNyG — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) August 30, 2016

ORIGINAL ARTICLE:

There were a few clues that Teddy Bridgewater's injury was worse than your garden-variety ACL tear.

First, an ambulance showed up to the Vikings practice field. (UPDATE: A 911 dispatcher described the injury as a "dislocated knee." The Star-Tribune published the audio. The Vikings later said it was a dislocation and an ACL tear) Then, coach Mike Zimmer gave a somber press conference, adding that the injury was "significant" and non-contact. That's never a good sign.

Now, the details are starting to filter out — and they're ugly. Vikings players vomited at the sight of the injury, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport (via Mike Loyko).

Bridgewater was set to start his third season with the Vikings. Minnesota doesn't have much of a contingency plan in place, but that's secondary at this point.
