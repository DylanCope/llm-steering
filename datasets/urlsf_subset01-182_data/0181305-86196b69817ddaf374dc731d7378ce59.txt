Earlier this year, in April, Xiaomi launched Mi 6 smartphone in two variants — 6GB RAM + 64GB storage and 6GB RAM + 128GB storage. Now, the company has launched another variant of the smartphone which comes with 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage.

Apart from the memory, all the remaining specifications of the smartphone remains unchanged. It flaunts a 5.15-inch Full HD display with screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.
