Everyone deserves access to basic human rights, yet 784 million people in the world do not have the ability to get safe and clean water. This is roughly 1 in 9 of the world's population (The Water Project).

Many people, women and girls especially, bear the burden of walking miles at a time to gather water from ponds and streams that are full of water-born diseases that is making them and their families sick. This is robbing communities of their future (The Water Project).

I am helping my friend, Rachael Pace, founder of Solea Water, to be a part of the solution to end this water crisis.

I want to "walk" with the people who have to carry water jugs by carrying my own water jug all day every day.

My goal is to raise $7,500, which will go towards purchasing a windmill aqueduct for Solea Water. This is a community level water system that both filters and purifies the water. How does it work? A centrally located windmill and water tank is constructed and pipelines carry clean water to tap stands between the residents homes. Then, the people do not have to carry water jugs like mine to get water!
