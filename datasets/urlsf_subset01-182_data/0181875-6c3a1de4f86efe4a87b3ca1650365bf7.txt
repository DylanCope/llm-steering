The owner of the popular Kaldi’s Social House completely rejected a claim by a local blogger that the store would be closing.

“We are going to replace some of the furniture and some of the kitchen equipment that we had,” said Tsega Haile, who opened the coffee shop at 918 Silver Spring Ave. in September of 2013.

“We are planning to add one espresso machine,” he added, “because we’re getting busy on the weekend, just to cut the line.”

Kaldi’s will add pour-over coffee to the menu, and after 4 p.m., will start serving coffee liquor drinks on the first floor.

The online auction will end Monday and winning bidders must pick up their items on Tuesday between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., Haile said. There will be no interruption in service that day.

In the past, patrons could only get coffee drinks in the evening on the first floor, while there was bar service at the rooftop lounge, which opened in 2014 and was remodeled last year.

The coffee house also serves pastries and casual foods such as breakfast sandwiches, bagels and waffles.
