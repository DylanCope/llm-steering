San Antonio FC has continued to get the job done, extending their undefeated streak, all be it in unspectacular fashion as they managed a scoreless draw against Oklahoma City Energy FC at Taft Stadium on Saturday night.

The result takes San Antonio FC’s undefeated streak to 13 matches, and extends goalkeeper Diego Restrepo’s clean sheet streak to seven matches. Restrepo now has gone over 10 hours of play without conceding a goal, but the team is still struggling at the other end of the park.

San Antonio FC head coach Darren Powell was pleased with another clean sheet after the match saying “That makes seven clean sheets in a row, which is something that takes a lot of hard work and effort from every player. There’s a lot to build on and we earned another point on the road, and now we look to keep improving week after week.”

In truth there was little for either keeper to do in the match with just a combined shots on target mark of three. Two of those fell to Oklahoma City Energy as Restrepo was able to make two fairly comfortable saves.

“It’s good to keep getting clean sheets and giving our team a chance to earn at least a point every match.” Said Restrepo, “it’s great to continue recording shutouts but the important thing is to come away with results, and now we just have to keep improving.”

Again the San Antonio defense was impressive as they held out the Energy blocking two shots. San Antonio FC again lost the possession battle, but just barely, but they were rarely troubled thanks to a strong defensive performance, with Stephen McCarthy particularly impressive, making nine clearances and intercepting two passes.

The continued lack of finishing touch will worry San Antonio FC, who for the second straight week were able to create chances but not put any of them away. That will concern Powell at least slightly, but despite frustration up front
