So after my two previous Mighty No.9 pieces, people were asking me to do more. A LOT of people. So since drawing mega bots has been an addiction of mine for years... Well, this happened.



Decided it would be too boring to just draw the last so-far revealed boss character, and I wanted to do something with a bit of energy in it. So I picked my favorite version of Beck's support character: Call, put her on that awesome dog-bike in the concept arts and had her dodge Number 5's minigun in the city area they've revealed.



This gave me a chance to tidy up some things I didn't like about my first Mighty piece, so I'm fairly happy about that. We'll see if I get tempted to do more, but for now, I'll try not to spam the internet with tons of robots. At least, not immediately...



Enjoy!
