Burma annuls Suu Kyi's election victory

Updated

Burma's military government has annulled the last election held in the country, which was won in a landslide by the party of Aung San Suu Kyi.

Burma's last elections were won in a landslide by the National League for Democracy party led by Aung San Suu Kyi.

Ms Suu Kyi won about 80 per cent of the vote but was immediately placed under house arrest, where she has remained for much of the past 20 years.

Burma is due to hold its first election since then later this year.

The military government has this week been releasing the rules for the poll, which include a clause that Ms Suu Kyi's party must expel her if they want to participate in the vote.

International observers are dismayed by the move, which will add to fears that the election will be a sham.
