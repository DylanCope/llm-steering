President Obama on Tuesday announced that 73 more companies are supporting his drive for an international climate change agreement.

Tuesday’s announcement of additions to the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, which comes in the beginning days of the United Nations meeting in Paris aimed at finalizing an international pact, nearly doubles the number of companies participating in the program.

By taking the pledge, the companies are saying they support a “strong agreement” in the Paris negotiations, and that they will undertake efforts in their own companies to help fight climate change.

It’s meant to show opponents of Obama’s climate agenda, like congressional Republicans, that corporate America is on the president’s side.

Obama is wrapping up his two-day visit to the Paris negotiations on Tuesday.

More than 150 companies have now signed on to the pledge.

The signatories announced Tuesday include big, recognizable names like Amazon.com Inc., DuPont, Staples Inc., MGM Resorts International, JetBlue Airways Corp. and 21st Century Fox, the parent company of the right-leaning Fox News Channel.

Many of the companies on the pledge separately bought an ad Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal expressing their support for a low-carbon economy and for a strong deal in Paris.

“We want this economy to be energy efficient and low carbon,” they wrote in the ad. “We believe there are cost-effective and innovative solutions that can help us achieve that objective. Failure to tackle climate change could put America’s economic prosperity at risk. But the right action now would create jobs and boost competitiveness.”

The 69 companies signing on to that ad include DuPont, Microsoft Corp., Unilever, Coca-Cola Co. and other big national and multinational names.
