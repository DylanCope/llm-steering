GARDENA (CBSLA.com) — A mother of two was in custody Wednesday after allegedly driving under the influence when she crashed her vehicle into a Southern California Edison power pole in Gardena.

Adrienne Lynette Barre, 33, was taken into custody after the accident, which occurred around 10:10 p.m. Monday on west 135th Avenue near Normandie Avenue, according to Gardena police.

Barre crashed her 1995 Chevrolet Suburban into the curb, the utility pole and an electrical box, which knocked out power to 1,205 SoCal Edison customers in the area of El Segundo Boulevard, Vermont Avenue, St. Andrews Place and Rosecrans Avenue, officials said.

She was booked into the Gardena jail on suspicion of drunken driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher and child endangerment. Her two children — an 11-year-old boy who was sitting in the front passenger seat and a 9-year-old girl in the rear seat — were not injured and placed into the custody of a grandmother.

According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Barre had a state identification card but not a driver’s license. Her driving privileges would have been suspended if she had one when she was cited Aug. 3, 2009 for driving with an “excessive blood-alcohol level”. She was eligible to get a driver’s license on Dec. 3, 2012, but she never obtained one, according to records.

She was also convicted of “disturbing the peace” in 2005, according to Los Angeles County Superior Court records.

Power was restored to most customers by 11:45 p.m. Monday.
