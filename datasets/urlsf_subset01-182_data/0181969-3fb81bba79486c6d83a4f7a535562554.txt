President Trump isn’t going to like this one.

Twitter is out with it’s most retweeted and "liked" tweets of 2017, and the president — who has made Twitter a central part of his presidency — didn’t make the top 10 most retweeted or the top three most liked. But you know who did? Former president Barack Obama — multiple times.

Of the most retweeted tweets of 2017 from around the world, Obama made the list three times. His tweets were also two out of the top three most liked.

The former president’s tweet with a photo of him looking into a room full of multi-racial kids on August 12 — the day of violent protests at a white nationalist rally in Virginia — was the second most retweeted.

"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion..." the tweet read. That photo also was Twitter’s most liked tweet of the year.

On that same day, President Trump said that “many sides” were to blame for the display of “of hatred, bigotry and violence.”

Obama’s call for Americans to believe in their ability to make change just over a week before the end of his presidency made No. 5.

And the day after Trump was inaugurated, Obama’s tweet saying being president was the “honor of my life” got ranked eighth of the top 10 most retweeted.

Obama’s tweet after Arizona Sen. John McCain — who he ran against for president in 2008 — announced he had brain cancer was the third most liked tweet of the year.

While Trump didn’t make the most retweeted or liked lists, he was the most tweeted-about elected official in the world and the U.S.

The most retweeted tweet of the year was by a 17-year-old Nevada resident who asked Wendy’s how many retweets he would need for a year of free chicken nuggets. Wendy’s responded 18 million. Carter Wilkerson was asking for help.

The full lists, as provided by Twitter, are below:
