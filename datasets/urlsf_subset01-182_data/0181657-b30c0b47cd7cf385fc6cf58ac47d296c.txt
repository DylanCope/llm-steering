This is not a joke. Big E can officiate your wedding if your big day happens to be taking place in LA between April 20th to 22nd.

I may be officiating weddings in LA April 20-22. Hit me if you're weird. [email protected] I'm actually not joking. For once. — ShinigamE (@WWEBigE) April 12, 2017

How Can Big E Legally Marry People?

Apparently anyone can apply for and receive a licence to marry people. This Boston Globe article goes into further detail about how many weddings are now being officiated by people who apply for one-day licenses to legally marry people.

Why would Big E want to do this? Big E’s manner of speaking and voice would make him a very entertaining addition to anyone’s wedding. Not a bad sidekick for 1/3 of the longest reigning WWE tag champs of all-time.

No word on if Big E has been contacted by Laurel Van Ness.
