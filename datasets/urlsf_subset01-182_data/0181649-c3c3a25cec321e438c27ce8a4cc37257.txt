There appears to be some uh . . . work being done to a few of the (long-time-since-they’ve-been-rented) rooms at the former Downtown Days Inn building at 801 St. Joseph Pkwy., also known as Houston’s last remaining (for now) abandoned skyscraper. Look at the lowest level of windows above the parking garage in the top photo. See how the windows appear to be busted out —in a way that’s maybe somewhat different from how many of the other windows are busted out? A somewhat systematic regime of glass removal appears to be working its way up the building’s southern façade, according to a quick comparison of the shot at top, taken today, and this one, from a slightly different angle, taken almost exactly a month earlier:

Accompanying the glass clearance, a bit of graffiti adjustment appears to be going on. Last spotted sporting a bit of volunteer greenery on its roof (see second photo above), the 31-story building has been known at various times during its 41-year history as a Days Inn; a Holiday Inn; the Heaven on Earth Plaza Hotel; the Maharishi Vedic School; and the Houston Downtown Plaza Hotel. Last year, building owner SFK Development reported plans to rehab it.
