Doom is excellent. Im not gonna lie here, my initial expectations were low, I expected a slow pace modern wannabe shooter consistent with the quality of games ID put up recently. I was blown away, I am a massive fan of the series and saw that this doom was everything I wanted. It is fast-paced, gore filled fun that only doom can deliver. My original guess was that it was going to pander to console players by making it slower ( I thought this after I saw the scroll wheel that slowed down game play.) It has been a long while since I have seen a shooter with intelligent map design, design which rewards players for playing the game at a faster pace, in fact I rarely found myself stopping in between combat, if at all. There is secrets galore in this game to. Not only that but the game itself is absolutely beautiful. From the large bosses to the small imps for pistol fodder every part of the game does not lack in design, This game reinvigorated my faith in ID. The online has obviously improved since the beta (Its great, i didn't get the chance to play the beta but I heard complaints) With a larger selections of weapons. In fact I see so many modding possibilities for the multiplayer on PC. After playing leagues and leagues of modern shooters this is the most refreshing multiplayer I have played in a while and will suck in hours and hours of my time I haven't really played around with snap map yet, but Ill be looking forward to it!. Anyway this reinvigorated the franchise and will forever be known as a classic, Amazing job id, i look forward for more
