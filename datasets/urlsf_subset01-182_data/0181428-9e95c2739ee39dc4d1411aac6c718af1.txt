If you see a van or bus with the words "Save the Storks" on its side, it's likely a fully equipped mobile ultrasound vehicle that provides pregnancy tests for women.

Joseph Baker, who heads the organization Save the Storks, explains what it's all about.

“We're excited to do this because most women who are choosing abortion feel cornered by abortion nowadays,” he says. “Basically, the main work we do is ... building these high-end mobile units that provide sonograms and pregnancy tests and all of the resources of a local center on the road, which allows some of these mobile units to park right in front of abortion clinics.”

Some of the units are dispatched to low-income areas because that's where most of the abortion clinics terminate the lives of babies. Invariably, women seeking abortions do an about-face following a sonogram and choose life for their preborn children. Baker says so far there are 22 mobile units around the country.

“Everywhere from Seattle to San Antonio to near the Chicago area - I mean, they're just all over America now,” he says. “There are 22 launched, and I think we’ve got six or seven in California. We actually have seven in production, and we have about 11 we're fundraising for.”

On average, four of five women who board the buses make a decision for life. When the first bus launched in New Jersey, 394 preborn babies were saved in just the first year.

Save the Storks is in the process of developing even more innovative techniques just for the sake of life.
