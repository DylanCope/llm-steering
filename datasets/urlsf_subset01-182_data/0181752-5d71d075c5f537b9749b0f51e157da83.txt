“Yes, we received information that she was from UP (University of the Philippines). I’m just not sure which (campus),” said Police Sr. Supt. Alden Delvo, Batangas provincial director.

A relative of Lapera confirmed to the Inquirer that she was from UP Manila.

Lapera was the 15th fatality in the encounter between New People’s Army rebels and the Philippine Air Force in Nasugbu Batangas on Tuesday evening.

Fourteen rebels were killed in the clash while two Air Force officials were wounded. Of the 15, five of them were female, Delvo said.

Meanwhile, another suspected rebel, Victoriano Almario, is being treated at the Medical Center Western Batangas in Balayan town.

Almario reportedly drove the jeepney, one of the two vehicles, that ferried the rebels.

The bodies of 14 fatalities are currently at the St. Peter’s funeral home in Nasugbu. Their identities were not immediately available as relatives have yet to claim the cadavers. /jpv
