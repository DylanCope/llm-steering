The traveling press corps covering Donald Trump‘s rally in Cincinnati had to be escorted out the back door of the event to a heavily guarded motorcade after being greeted with boos, middle fingers and a seemingly “arena-wide” chant of “Tell the truth!” from a crowd of 15,000 people, according to a pool report.

The motorcade outside the Thursday rally was guarded by local police in riot gear, among others, the pool report says.

Reporters were also met with chants of “CNN sucks,” which have become routine at Trump rallies this week, according to Politico.

These attacks on the press come after repeated rallying calls from the GOP nominee himself, who has frequently painted the media as dishonest and in cahoots with liberals. But Politico reports that Trump’s supporters have increasingly begun targeting the press on their own amid the GOP nominee’s claims that the new sexual assault allegations against him are part of a conspiracy by the media and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Attendees of the Thursday rally called members of the press “whores” and “press-titutes” as they left the event, minutes after Trump accused reporters of conspiring against both his campaign and American workers.

Trump made similar claims about the media and Clinton’s campaign at an event in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Thursday, saying, “The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media. The reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton campaign on helping her win the election all over.”

At another event in Panama City, he said, “Reporters who work for these outlets like Washington Post or The New York Times may think of themselves as journalists, but they’re actually just cogs in a corporate, political machine.”
