Amber Rudd has hinted Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK could be delayed after the US President launched a direct attack on Theresa May for criticising his decision to retweet anti-Islamic hate videos.

Mr Trump publicly chastised Mrs May on Wednesday evening after Downing Street said the President was “wrong” to have shared the content with his 43.6 million followers on Twitter.

Ms Rudd repeated Mrs May’s condemnation of Mr Trump as she told MPs that the Prime Minister would never back away from challenging the President over his behaviour.

Mr Trump’s initial decision to retweet the material sparked a fierce backlash in the UK and his subsequent attack on the PM has hardened calls for the Government to withdraw the invitation of a state visit.

One government source suggested yesterday that the trip had been "kicked into grass as long as it can get" and Ms Rudd, the Home Secretary, hinted today that the visit may be delayed.
