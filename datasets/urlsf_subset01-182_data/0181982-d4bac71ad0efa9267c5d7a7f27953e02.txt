The Game of Thrones star reprises his role as a grizzly Lord off-screen in a fight outside a London bar!

Sean Bean, 52, found himself in a real-life battle on June 13th. However this time, it wasn’t over control of the Iron Throne, but rather his lady-friend, 22-year-old Playboy playmate April Summers.

Bean, whose character “Ned” was just killed off the HBO show, went outside the Hill Bar and Brasserie with his Playboy Bunny beau for a smoke when a passerby recognized her and began to make bawdy comments. Bean stepped in and told the lewd loudmouth to leave. Shortly after, he returned and punched Bean in the face. A brawl broke out between the two, resulting in the tough-guy actor getting stabbed with broken glass in the arm. It is uncertain how the scuffle ended, but it begs to question, “what happened to the other guy?”

Although he refused to go to the hospital, Sean politely cleaned himself up with a first-aid kit and ordered another drink for he and his Playmate. What a true gentleman!
