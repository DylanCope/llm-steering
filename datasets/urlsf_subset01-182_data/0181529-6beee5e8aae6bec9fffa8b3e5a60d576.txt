SAN ANTONIO— Veterans are using new tactics to keep watch over fellow soldiers in need.

Buddy Check 22 is designed to help people who may suffer from PTSD.

Every month on the 22nd, active duty soldiers and prior military servicemen are getting in the routine of checking one another. Thru text, social media and emails, veterans reach out to those who may suffer from PTSD. The new push came after a Department of Veterans Affairs study estimated 22 soldiers took their own life every day in 2010.

Locally, former soldiers utilize the buddy check system daily.

"I do reach out. I try to put stuff on facebook and it works because people do contact me through messenger saying I'm glad that you posted this,” said veteran Veronica Cardona.

Since 2007, the VA Crisis Line reports they have answered 2 million phone calls from veterans looking for help. Of those calls, emergency crews were dispatched over 56,000 times.
