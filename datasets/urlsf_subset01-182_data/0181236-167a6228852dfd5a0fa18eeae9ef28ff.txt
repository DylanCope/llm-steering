Join us for the nineteenth meeting of the Brooklyn Hong Kong Mahjong Meetup! Our group gets together to learn about and play Hong Kong-style mahjong. For those new to the group, welcome! This is a casual event—no prior experience is required. We meet at Kings Games, a games shop located near the Kings Highway (Q) subway station. Please update your RSVP to accurately reflect whether or not you’ll be able to attend by the evening prior to the event. No-shows are tracked. If you can't make it right at the event's start time, that's fine, just let us know in advance. While we don't charge a fee to participants, the host location asks for $5 per attendee. Please pay your attendance at the downstairs cashier fee prior to meeting us upstairs.
