ISTANBUL â€” A female suicide bomber blew herself up near a historic mosque in the northwestern Turkish city of Bursa on Wednesday, wounding at least 13 people, officials said.

The explosion rocked the 14th-century Ulu Camii, or Grand Mosque, a popular tourist destination in a historic district of the city. Television reports showed shattered glass and debris from shops and restaurants close to the mosque. The police cordoned off the area as ambulances sped to the scene.

The Turkish health minister, Mehmet Muezzinoglu, said in a statement that none of the 13 people who were hospitalized were in critical condition.

The attack took place a few hours after the United States Embassy in Ankara issued a security advisory to American citizens, warning of credible threats against tourist destinations throughout Turkey.
