yea it should fix those issues that required people to fuck with their router settings to play online



"One solution for NAT traversal, called the Internet Gateway Device Protocol (IGD Protocol), is implemented via UPnP. Many routers and firewalls expose themselves as Internet Gateway Devices, allowing any local UPnP control point to perform a variety of actions, including retrieving the external IP address of the device, enumerate existing port mappings, and add or remove port mappings. By adding a port mapping, a UPnP controller behind the IGD can enable traversal of the IGD from an external address to an internal client."

Same as Windows 9. They do this to emphasise how huge the changes are.



So I guess this is goodbye to ICCUP? Smart of them to include fish, but it seems like iccup will be a thing of the past. Upnp support is great. Will feel really strange to play on official b.net servers, let's hope their anti-hack is actually any good.



It honestly feels like they actually read the rumour threads and listened to what fans wanted. Can't believe this is something blizz is doing in 2017. Same as Windows 9.

That's massive for me. Not being able to mess with my apartment's router is the reason I stopped playing BW. That'sfor me. Not being able to mess with my apartment's router is the reason I stopped playing BW.
