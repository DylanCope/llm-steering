UPDATE: Super duper proud of this piece-- it got onto Equestria Daily! Feel super cool, and so glad they've allowed me into their drawfriends again (link here: www.equestriadaily.com/2015/08â€¦ Chugging along goes the Productivity Train! Choo-choo! Today is Wednesday, so that means this is our first #ChibiWednesday ! Like all the other hashtags, all chibis can be found with #ChibiWednesday . I'm very proud of myself for sticking it out this long, and not caving in. To tell the truth I'm... kinda beginning to like this schedule. Crazy right?As far as chibi's go, I plan to do both human and pony chibis. Much like the mermaids, I'll never really run out of material for these, unless I choose to end it. So first I thought it naturally appropriate to start with ponies-- and start with Twilight, the purple magic pone! (This one, yeah.) I absolutely love the way this turned out. I had no clue this was going to turn out so... beautifully! I don't know if there's anything I dislike about this piece. I love the whole thing!Hey, if you like this too, please leave a comment/favorite. I love comments, a whole bunch! I was actually trying to decide if I should make this a print or not, and I can't decide if no one steps up, right? Or heck, even if you hated it let me know! I like constructive criticism, and I love compliments just as much. And if you REALLY like my stuff, go over to my homepage here and click that Donate button!
