Why is normal-hitfinish11 so loud? It hurts the ears every time it's used, much like how it hurts in Fast Paced Society.Why are normal-hitfinish11 and normal-hitfinish10 so large? 2822 kbps isn't a good bitrate for a wav in a beatmap, 1411 is what you'd want to use to save file size.You could shave off an entire MB just by re-encoding two wav files (there's more 2822 in the folder but those are the prime examples).EDIT: More stuff08:13:522 (1) - Repeat sliders that are short in duration are prime candidates for triggering an unwanted glitch.This glitch is most likely never going to be fixed.This is one of the reasons why FC'ing the end of StrangeProgram is so 'hard'.These repeats are 31ms long, so hitting the object 31ms late will guarantee combo break.In jump maps like this, players will often purposely hit later than usual to guarantee a hit. This'll pretty much screw them over.
