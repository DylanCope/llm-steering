She's a Syrian mother of five trapped inside the Syrian town of Madaya which has faced mass starvation, and grabbed international headlines, sadly, to little effect.

Madaya Mom battles hunger, depleting resources and violent threats on daily basis, desperately trying to feed mouths and provide safety amid the violent besiegement of her town.

ABC News and Marvel Comics, two Disney-owned companies, teamed up to tell Madaya Mom's story with a digital comic now available online, free of charge.

The comic is based on the true story of an anonymous woman ABC News' Lebanese producer Rym Momtaz came into contact with. The woman, unnamed for security reasons, has shared her experiences with ABC News through text messages and phone conversations.

Madaya Mom depicts raw insight into the dreadful reality of living under siege. "I didn’t want to do a war comic," said the Croatian artist, Dalibor Talajic, behind the illustrations. "I wanted to make a comic with a civilian point of view, where you’re really powerless."
