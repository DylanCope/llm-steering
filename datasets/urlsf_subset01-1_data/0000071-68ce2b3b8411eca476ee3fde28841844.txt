(SOUNDBITE) (Ukrainian) UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT, PETRO POROSHENKO, SAYING: "I don't want anyone to have any illusions. And because I don't want to be seen as naive I have to say: we are still a very long way from peace. Nobody strongly believes that the peace conditions which were signed in Minsk will be implemented strictly." The ceasefire is due to come into effect Sunday.
