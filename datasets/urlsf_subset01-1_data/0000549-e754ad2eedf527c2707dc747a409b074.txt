BRATISLAVA, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Slovakia said on Saturday it would close all but one road border crossing with Ukraine on Sunday because of Ukraine’s flu epidemic.



Vysne Nemecke, the biggest checkpoint, will be the only one to stay open.



"The reason is the continuing worsening of the epidemic situation in Ukraine," Interior Minister Robert Kalinak told journalists. "This is intended to minimize any eventual outbreak of the disease."



Kalinak said the EU member state’s decision was temporary and aimed to protect the bloc.



Doctors and hygienists will be stationed at the border to monitor passengers and have the powers to bar anyone suspected of being infected from entering the country.



Ukraine could delay a January presidential election until May next year because of its outbreak of H1N1 flu, which has killed more than 100 in recent weeks and infected more than 750,000 [ID:nL695938]. (Reporting by Martin Santa; editing by Andrew Roche)
