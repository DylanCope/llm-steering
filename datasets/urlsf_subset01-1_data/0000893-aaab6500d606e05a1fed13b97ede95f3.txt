Americans prefer Nickelback, root canals to Congress

It should be no surprise by now that Americans care very little for Congress. But, in case there was any doubt as to how much the American people hate their lawmakers, Public Policy Polling released a new poll on Tuesday showing some other things that are more popular: Root canals, for instance. Those NFL replacement referees. Even Canadian rock band Nickelback.

Overall, 85 percent of the surveyed American voters had an unfavorable opinion of Congress, while just nine percent viewed it favorably.
