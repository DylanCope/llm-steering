Although the FIA's World Motor Sport Council had ratified the principle of the change last week, procedural matters meant the wording of the new regulations had to go back to the Strategy Group and F1 Commission for approval.

With Ferrari having expressed some concerns about the changes, there had been a chance that the Maranello outfit may have elected to hold out on giving its support.

And without the unanimous approval that is needed, because the changes are coming into force this season, that could have meant F1 being forced to stick with the old format.

However, with e-votes having gone out to teams for their views on the new regulations, it is understood that all teams - including Ferrari - accepted the change.

All that is left now is for the FIA to make a formal change to the 2016 Sporting Regulations, which will need to be done before the start of the Melbourne weekend.

It means F1 qualifying will switch to a knock-out style format for all three segments from Melbourne.
