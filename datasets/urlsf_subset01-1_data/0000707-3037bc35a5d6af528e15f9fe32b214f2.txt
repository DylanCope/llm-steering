Sul Irmaos announced yesterday that it is closing its downtown Brampton location permanently after being open five years.

The restaurant has been a local favourite for that time, and even was once featured on the Food Network show ‘You Gotta Eat Here!’.

There’s good news, though. “Sul Irmaos Smokehouse is now on wheels,” the eatery wrote on its Facebook page. That’s right: as pictured below, there will be a food truck making the rounds at events and festivals going forward.

Sul Irmaos promises in its Facebook announcement that it will continue to update social media with its locations throughout the GTA, so even though we’ll miss the George St. South location, at least we’ll still get to eat its awesome food in the future.
