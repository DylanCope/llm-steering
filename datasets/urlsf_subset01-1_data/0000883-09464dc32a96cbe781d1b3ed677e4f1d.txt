A Cleveland newspaper is welcoming King James back with a gift fit for a (sports) royal: a reporter dedicated to his every move.

The Northeast Ohio Media Group, which represents the Plain Dealer newspaper and Cleveland.com, has posted a job ad looking for an "expert on LeBron James and what he means to Northeast Ohio."

According to the description, the reporter will be "analyzing and reporting on James' personal sports statistics, his mentoring of younger players and his relationship with his coaches as well as his non-basketball forays in business, entertainment and other enterprises."

Sure, that sounds like fun: The reporter, after all, will travel with James around the country as the Cavaliers and track his every move. But is being King James' shadow truly the best job ever? Here at The Wire, we break it down, just as the thorough job posting does:

The Requirements

The ad delivers a slew of expected bullet points for a job of this caliber: A bachelor's degree, reporting experience, SEO familiarity, etc. But The One will also "need to be flexible enough to work many nights and weekend, particularly during basketball season."

Ah, of course. The reporter will be expected to be at every Cavs game. We'll chalk that up under the "Yes, This Is The Best Job Ever" column.
