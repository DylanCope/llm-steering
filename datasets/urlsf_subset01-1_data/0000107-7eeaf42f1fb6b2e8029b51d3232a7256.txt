Washington (CNN) In Jerusalem earlier Tuesday, President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump, as well as (perpetual shadows) Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, were on hand at a wreath-laying ceremony at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum.

The event was standard, solemn fare for visiting dignitaries; the memorial is one of the most sacred sites in Israel, second in visitors to the Western Wall.

As is tradition for most world leaders, Trump and the first lady also signed the guest book. Here's what the president wrote, via @RaoulWootliff:

"It is a great honor to be here with all of my friends. So amazing + will Never Forget!"

@realDonaldTrump @PresidentRuvi This is @realDonaldTrump's message in Yad Vashem's Book of Remembrance. "So amazing + will NEVER FORGET!"

Tweeted out, the Internet went bonkers. Not only was Trump's inscription fewer than 140 characters -- a Twitter post limit he must know well by now -- it resembles something more akin to what you might jot down on a Hallmark 'Thank You' card, less something to commemorate the occasion of the leader of the free world paying respects at a memorial.
