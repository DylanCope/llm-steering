Dude, anyone can come up with ideas

Please don't take this very personally.You said you'd start working on this one city at a time when the creation kit comes out, but honestly you can't do that. You can't make a thing like this piecemeal, whenever inspiration happens to strike you. I'm telling you this right now just to save you a headache. If you don't in advance plan out everything, and I mean literally everything from factions to cities to quests and goals and custom equipment, magic, balance, everything you want to achieve with this, then eventually, and hopefully sooner rather than later, you will realize that you've completely painted yourself into a corner and there's no way you can reintroduce internal consistency into your mod. It will be a huge mess and you'll become discouraged and either start over, totally demoralizing anyone who in good faith decided to work on this with you, or you'll just quit.Bethesda had an enormous team doing worldbuilding for this game, and I mean they had people just doing design, you know, the step you're basically skipping in your enthusiasm. And this team took a really long time to turn out this product. This project will take you years, and right now you're probably young, I mean that's an assumption but let's just say, and you don't know it yet but things happen in life abruptly, you go to college and get engaged and start a job and suddenly that enormous time-sink of a video game mod project just doesn't justify itself in your schedule anymore.So you're going into this very willy-nilly, that's one thing, however there's something else, and this is perhaps even a little more crucial.cire992 posted:and although his point was more that just having the enthusiastic "idea man" won't take a project very far, it scratches on more: that this isn't even your idea. The Song of Ice and Fire is someone else's life's work, and no I'm not going all copyright nonsense on you, I'm saying that your time, pretty much the most valuable resource you've got, should be spent on your own idea. You like those books and you don't think I'm being serious and poignant but what you're literally proposing here is years of time invested into what would basically amount to fan fiction.If you want to use the cell editor to turn out some thematic maps as a couple-of-hours-a-week hobby then that's totally reasonable, but that won't get done what you're proposing and it's irresponsible to drum up support for something that will never happen on a forum with a lot of young and impressionable users whose lives still have potential beyond alpha neckbeard.
