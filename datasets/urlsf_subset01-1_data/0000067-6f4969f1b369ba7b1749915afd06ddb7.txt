A bill making its way through the Arizona Legislature could make it a misdemeanor to hop in a car, as a passenger, without proper identification.

Deputy Pima County Attorney Kathleen Mayer argued that requiring all passengers carry proper identification could help officers when they suspect a passenger is acting illegally.

House Bill 2305 prompted plenty of questions from members on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Wednesday.

Democrat Representative Jesus Rubalcava pointed out how easily the law could be abused.

“I have a problem with the severity of criminalizing individuals based on not being able to show an ID, simply just by being in the passenger seat of a car without a seat belt," Rubalcava said.

"There has to be a reasonable suspicion to stop you. And the law already requires you, as the driver, to have a driver's license," said Mayer. "If everyone is buckled in when an officer pulls a vehicle over, and they're not doing anything wrong, they cannot be compelled to provide identification."



The committee voted to pass the passenger ID bill, but warned it may not have the same members' support if nothing is changed to protect passengers' civil rights before it goes to the House floor for a full vote.



As it’s currently written, passengers found without an ID could face up to four months in jail and a $750 fine.
