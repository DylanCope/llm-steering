YouTube’s streaming TV service is adding several new channels today, including AMC, BBC America, IFC, Sundance TV, and WE TV. Some of those are pretty big names, so today’s addition goes a long way toward fleshing out YouTube TV’s offerings and making it a much more viable alternative to a traditional cable package.

9to5Google first spotted today’s additions. Telemundo and Universo also appear to have been added about two weeks ago.

None of this is a surprise, though. At launch, YouTube said that all of these channels were coming, as well as a few others like ESPN3, but there wasn’t a date for when any of them would arrive. With today’s channel update, the biggest pending names are now live — so YouTube TV subscribers are good to catch up on The Walking Dead and Doctor Who.
