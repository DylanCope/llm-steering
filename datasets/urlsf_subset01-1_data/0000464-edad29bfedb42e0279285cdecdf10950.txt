Renowned multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, producer and now ringleader, Devin Townsend is gearing up for one of his biggest accomplishments to date: The Retinal Circus. Set to take place on October 27 at London, England's historic Roundhouse venue, this one-night-only event will be recorded for both DVD and Blu-ray, likely to be released sometime in the second quarter of 2013 via InsideOut Music.

Devin describes The Retinal Circus as "a retrospective of my career in music to date, with the central theme being a metaphor of how life and the adventures therein are a 'circus' of sorts. The show involves a cast of characters and guests that support this theme through carnival type performances. A story about how a troubled young man dreams of fantastic scenarios, (illustrated through the music of my back catalogue), which ultimately crests in the characters realization that life is all about the relationships we have with each other. This is the first opportunity I have been given to make theatrical representations of my music."

* A retrospective of Devin Townsend's entire career

* Full choir and theatrical cast
