Google's stock hit $800 a share in early trading Tuesday for the first time in the company's history.

Google's stock had passed $700 a share in early September for the first time in nearly five years, but it crashed below that the following month after the company's third quarter earnings report leaked early, revealing some troubling figures.

More recently, though, the stock has been on a gradual rebound thanks to the continued success of Android, strong advertising revenue and a settlement with the FTC that forced only minor concessions from Google. The company posted its first ever $50 billion year in 2012 as sales beat analysts estimates in the December quarter.

While investors continue to doubt whether Apple has another breakthrough product in the works, Google has shown the world that it has several, including broadband, driverless cars and Google Glass. Google's stock is now trading at an all-time high; Apple's stock is still struggling to get back to the right side of $500.

As of publication, Google's stock was trading at around $803 a share.
