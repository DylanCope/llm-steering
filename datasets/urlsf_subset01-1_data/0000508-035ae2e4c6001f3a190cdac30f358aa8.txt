Dzhokar Tsarnaev - On Tha Run 19 Years Of AgeTamerlan Tsarnaev - DEAD 26 years of AgeHis VK: vk.com/id160300242 Tamerlan Tsarnaev's youtube page: www.youtube.com/user/muazseyfullah/videos The Boston suburb of www.nytimes.com/2013/04/20/us/boston-marathon-bombings.html? ;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;_r=0 has been placed on lockdown after one of the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects, who was wearing an explosive device, was run over and killed after a massive shootout with state and local law enforcement. A number of terrestrial websites have named suspect #1, however We, Ourselves, have no confirmation from Entry Court or the Laal Hethri as to the name of the dead suspect. Watertown, Massachusetts is five and one half miles from the scene of the Boston Marathon bombing and is a community of approximately 32,000 Souls. The Massachusetts National Guard has responded to the incident sending in several Humvees and placing troops on the streets to assure the citizens of Watertown, Massachusetts stay sheltered in place.The two suspects are alleged to have robbed a local 7 Eleven, shot and killed an MIT Police Officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and attempted a carjacking on a driver in a Mercedes. MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski has described these two men as “sick minds” who are brothers one of which who is still at large is 19 years old has a Massachusetts driver’s license named Dzhokar Tsarnaev. The two are in the United States legally and have been in the country for at least one year. Tsarnaev is not, We , repeat not the Indian man identified in error by BigFurHat at iowntheworld.com/blog/?p=181754 as a student missing from Brown University. This makes twice that this conservative blog has swallowed information that would have potentially led to the bodily harm of a living Soul via misidentification and this information is being passed along to the Laal Hethri.
