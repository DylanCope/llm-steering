RAIPUR: Opposition Congress in Chhattisgarh suffered a jolt on Friday when its candidate for the byelection at Antagarh reserved seat, withdrew his nomination at the last minute and went underground, leaving the grand old party in a shock.Congress candidate Manturam Pawar, a senior tribal leader, allegedly remained untraceable even as the state party brass desperately tried to reach him. Congress was gearing up to put up a tough fight in Antagarh (ST), where polling is scheduled for September 13, the first bypoll after BJP government retained power for the third consecutive time in assembly polls last year.Kanker district collector Alermelmangai D confirmed the development and Pawar could not be reached for comment.Opposition Congress alleged ruling BJP was behind Pawar's vanishing act, but maintained the party would make a statement once it got to the bottom of the issue.Pawar was a legislator between 1998 and 2003 ? in undivided Madhya Pradesh and later Chhattisgarh. In the 2008 and 2013 polls, he lost to BJP's Vikram Usendi. In 2008, Usendi managed a narrow win by just 109 votes while in 2013 his margin significantly rose to more than 5,000 votes.Bypoll to Antagarh (ST) seat was necessitated following resignation of Vikram Usendi from the Vidhan Sabha consequent to his election to the Lok Sabha in May this year.As many as 14 candidates filed their nomination for the bypoll and an independent candidate's papers were rejected during scrutiny. BJP has fielded Bhojram Nag as its candidate while its district unit's vice-president Raghunath Kumeti had also entered the fray as a rebel candidate.
