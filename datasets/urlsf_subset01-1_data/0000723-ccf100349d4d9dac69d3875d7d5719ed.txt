I usually go for a top 5 list. But I couldn’t find 5 scary movies this year so far. Even though I liked movies like “Cabin in the Woods’ and “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter’, those are just not good enough to scare people. So here are the 3 scariest movies that can keep you awake at night.

01. The Woman in Black

The Woman in Black is a ghost movie and I consider it’s a must watch movie released in 2012. It’s a story about a little village terrorized by a dead woman who’s seeking for revenge of her son’s death. This movie has tested my limits. I did my best to keep my mouth shut while watching it and not to think about it when I wake up middle of the night. It was that scary, so far the best scary movie this year. It’ll surely freak you out. I won’t go into details much. I’ll just let you watch and enjoy it. It’s a movie worth watching. I don’t like how it ended though. But combination of dark moving backgrounds and music will test your limits. Great performances by “Harry Potter” star Daniel Radcliffe.

Plot: A young lawyer travels to a remote village where he discovers the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.

02. The Devil Inside

The Devil Inside is another creepy movie released earlier this year. It’s a documentary style movie. I normally hate documentary movies. But there’s something in this movie that kept me interested. I hear lots of negative reviews about it. But movie was not disappointing. Sure it was a low-budget movie. But in my opinion, it’s scary enough to be in second on this list. It’s a story about demons taking control over human bodies. Honestly I believe these stuff. In my society, we have special methods to treat these people, which often involved with sacrificing of chickens in exchange of human body (Basically making a deal with demon). The Devil Inside also doesn’t have the greatest ending. But it’s worth watching. You have to be a believer to enjoy it to its full capacity.

Plot: In Italy, a woman becomes involved in a series of unauthorized exorcism during her mission to discover what happened to her mother, who allegedly murdered three people during her own exorcism.

03. Chernobyl Diaries

Chernobyl Diaries is another movie worth watching. I can’t say it’ll scare you to hell. But it has its moments to scare you. It has a good storyline. It’s about 3 tourist couples going for an adventure on an abandoned city near Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. They have been told that everyone lived there were left 25 years ago. But they soon find out that they are stuck in the city and not everyone has left 25 years ago. Stage is set for a great horror by halfway of the movie, but it never happened in the end. It leaves unanswered questions and ending didn’t amuse me. Plus, you never get a good look at things that are killing these people. Movie is good enough to be in this list. But it could have been a better movie.

Plot: Six tourists hire an extreme tour guide who takes them to the abandoned city Pripyat, the former home to the workers of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. During their exploration, they soon discover they are not alone.

These are my favorites so far this year. Although none of it ended the way I liked. It’s becoming the nature of this genre. None of these movies has disgusting scenes or sex on it. So if you’re looking for those this is not the list for you. You may consider “Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning”. So enjoy and be scared. Watch out for dogs if you’re watching The Devil Inside.
