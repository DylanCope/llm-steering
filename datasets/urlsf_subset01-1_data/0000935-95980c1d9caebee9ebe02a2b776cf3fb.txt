I meant to post about this earlier, but the day got away from me. Fox News has been obsessed with the Obama administration for not using the term "radical Islam" whenever there's a terrorist attack or whenever ISIS does something horrendous. They are trying to convince their flock that by not using their designated term, the terrorists are winning and are just about ready to cross the Mexican border.

It's simple minded I know, but they need something to attack the administration with. It doesn't matter what term we call ISIS or whoever because that will not change one thing and conservatives know this very well. They are high on the hog of terrorism heaven since national security is dominating the news and do they ever revel in these times.

AG Eric Holder took them to task at The National Press Club over it.

“We spend more time, more time talking about what you call it, as opposed to what do you do about it, you know?” Holder said during an appearance at the National Press Club. “I mean really. If Fox didn’t talk about this, they would have nothing else to talk about, it seems to me.” Holder argued that referring to incidents of violence as “radical Islam” or “Islamic extremism” did not alter how the administration handled any particular case." What we have to do is defined not by the terms that we use, but by the facts on the ground,” he said. “So I don’t worry an awful lot about what the appropriate terminology ought to be. I think that people need to actually think about that, and think about will we be having this conversation about words as opposed to what our actions ought to be? This is a difficult problem.”

I'm not sure how smart it is for Holder to slam Fox News over their crude fearmongering tactics because it just gives them a chance to get on their high horse and whine for days on end about it.
