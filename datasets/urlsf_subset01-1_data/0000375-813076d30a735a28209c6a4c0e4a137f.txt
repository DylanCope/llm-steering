I am still testing this deck, but thought I would share it to get some help on improving it and comments.

Basic Strategy

Use Legwork and Account Siphon to apply early pressure on HQ, force the corp to concentrate on securing HQ and grab some early agendas. Legwork works wonders in the beginning to grab some agendas before the Corp gets set up, since you will access 3 out of 5 cards at once. Once accessing HQ becomes too difficult, put down the R&D interfaces and switch to R&D attacks to dig for the winning agendas.

Economy

Next to operations economy, Desperado and Tenma (in combo with the run events) are the backbone of your econ so make sure to make good use of them. Thanks to the VoicePADs and SOT you can keep running for a while without running out of steam.

Honorable Mentions

Clone Chips Use these either for recycling faeries or to reset a Femme Fatale or retrieve trashed breakers.

Gordian Blade + Corroder These cards work wonders together with faerie to cheaply break any ice you encounter.

Prepaid VoicePAD After some testing I chose Prepaid VoicePad over Public Terminal since you will save more money in the long run, since there are also a substantial number of non-run events in here.

Planned Assault This card is a gold-mine as it lets you find the events you need for a specific situation: Heavily Iced-up Remot? Get an Inside Job. Low on money? Get a Dirty Laundry or Account Siphon!

The deck is no yet perfect and certainly not tier 1, but a lot of fun to play and I won 6 out of 6 games so far. Looking forward on hearing your comments and thoughts on how to improve this.
