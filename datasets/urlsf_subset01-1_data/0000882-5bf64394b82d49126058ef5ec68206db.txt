A five day public inquiry took place at Westminster City Hall in May, where the Planning Inspectorate heard the developer CTLX’s appeal against the enforcement notice served by the council, which demanded that the pub be rebuilt as close to the original as possible. The inquiry received evidence from local campaign groups, residents, councillors and Historic England. The planning inspector dismissed the appeals lodged by the developers and has ruled in favour of Westminster City Council, giving CLTX two years to rebuild the pub.

This decision is a just reward for the work of all the local campaigners who have fought so hard to right this wrong.” Westminster City Council has stood side by side with residents to demand that the Carton Tavern should be rebuilt brick by brick. Our planning officers and residents made a strong case in May at the public inquiry. I am pleased that we have won the battle and I look forward to seeing the Carlton Tavern turned back into a thriving community pub.” This sends a clear message to developers across the country that they cannot ride roughshod over the views of local communities. – Cllr Robert Davis MBE DL, Westminster City Council Cabinet Member for the Built Environment

The historic pub was demolished in April 2015, in breach of planning laws and despite the fact it was being considered for Grade II listing. The planning inspector agreed that it was “highly likely that it would have been listed had it not been demolished”, calling it a “rare public house”. “I see no reason from the information available why a detailed and accurate reconstruction could not be undertaken,” said the inspector. The Carlton Tavern is an asset of community value and the planning inspector said that it was the “historical association, past usage, layout of the spaces, character and appearance of the previous building that has considerable importance for the community.”

Westminster City Council had rejected an application for redevelopment on the site in January 2015. This was also upheld by the planning inspector.

The levelling of the pub took place with no prior warning to the council, no approvals and no proper health and safety procedures in place.

The council served an enforcement notice to the developers, CLTX Ltd, requiring the rebuilding of the popular community pub “brick by brick”. However, CLTX Ltd have not done so and appealed the decision, but this appeal has now failed.
