× Former Destrehan teachers accused of having sex with a student formally charged in Jefferson Parish

JEFFERSON PARISH, La. (WGNO) – Formal charges have been brought against two former Destrehan High School teachers arrested last year for allegedly having sex with a 16-year-old student.

The Jefferson Parish District Attorney’s office charged 33-year-old Shelley Dufresne on two counts of carnal knowledge of a juvenile. 25-year-old Rachel Respess was charged with one count of failure to report the commission of certain felonies, according to the Advocate.

Kenner police arrested Dufresne and Respess in September 2014 after police say the male student was invited to Respess’ apartment and had sex with both women as the same time.

Respess’ lawyer, Jeffry Smith, told WGNO in March that his client didn’t have “consensual sex”.

“As you know, we have cases all over the press now about young girls who don’t seem to realize what happened to them,” Smith said.

Smith told the Advocate on Monday that Respess will not plead guilty.

Dufresne was also arrested for having sex with the student in St. Charles Parish. In April, Dufresne pleaded guilty to one felony count of obscenity. In the plea deal, she avoided prison time and did not have to register as a sex offender.
