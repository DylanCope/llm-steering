Microsoft is currently preparing a new Windows Phone 8 update, The Verge has learned. Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans have revealed that the software maker plans to support FM radio hardware in its latest update, returning a hardware feature that the company dropped with its latest mobile OS. Windows Phone 7 used to support FM radio hardware, and Microsoft has been working to bring this support back to Windows Phone 8. The hardware support will be part of a General Distribution Release (GDR2) for Windows Phone 8. We understand that the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 will support FM radio, while other compatible handsets will also include the support.

Nokia is also building in its own firmware improvements into GDR2. Sources familiar with Nokia's plans have revealed to The Verge that the company will add a new screen activation gesture. Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 owners will be able to double-tap the screen to wake the device from standby. Other firmware specific improvements from Nokia include a flip to silence option, and Lumia color profile settings for the device screen. We're told that the update, which is minor, will be made available over the coming months.
