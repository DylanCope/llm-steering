              "'It was like going into the belly of the beast.\\n\\nThis week in Washington is the annual “policy summit” of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a powerful, secretive organization funded by the Koch brothers and other corporate interests that is famous for drafting conservative legislation that Republican state legislatures adopt down to the last semicolon. And the news media were invited to attend!\\n\\nI descended the escalators at the Grand Hyatt downtown, two floors below street level, excited by the possibilities listed on the ALEC agenda:\\n\\nThe environment and energy task force, led by private-sector American Electric Power. The tax and fiscal policy task force, headed by Altria. The international relations task force, run by Philip Morris. The commerce and insurance task force, by State Farm. And the health and human services task force, by Guarantee Trust Life Insurance.\\n\\nAlas, I was quickly regurgitated from the belly of the beast. Outside the meeting rooms, a D.C. police officer, stationed to keep out the riffraff, turned me away.\\n\\n“Our business meetings are not open, and so the subcommittee meetings and task force meetings are not open,” explained Bill Meierling, an ALEC spokesman. I could wait a few hours and then attend a luncheon and some workshops, as long as I promised not to record them.\\n\\nBut Meierling wanted to assure me that there was nothing untoward about this arrangement, and that it was absolutely not true that the corporations that fund ALEC were behind closed doors, handing their legislative wish lists to the conservative state legislators who then pass them, rubber-stamp style, from coast to coast.\\n\\n“What you fundamentally need to know about this organization is it’s completely legislator driven,” he said.\\n\\nUh-huh. And ALEC is proving that by keeping reporters from the rooms where the legislators are or are not receiving their marching orders from corporate patrons.\\n\\nThis probably won’t fly much longer. ALEC has been a major force behind the conservative swing in state capitals, and it claims 82 alumni in the House — including Speaker John Boehner (Ohio) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.) — and 11 in the Senate. Its advisory council includes Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, Diageo, AT&T, Peabody Energy, Koch Industries and UPS, and exhibitors at its conference this week include the Charles Koch Institute, the Family Research Council and the Heritage Foundation. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) are addressing the conference.\\n\\nBut ALEC’s fortunes began to change with the killing of Trayvon Martin and the resulting attention to the danger of “stand your ground” laws, one of many initiatives ALEC spread from sea to shining sea. Some corporate sponsors, including Amazon, Coca-Cola, General Electric, Kraft, McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, quit ALEC. On Tuesday, the Guardian newspaper published a trove of internal ALEC documents showing how grim its situation has become.\\n\\nIt reported that the group has lost almost 400 state legislators in the past two years and more than 60 corporations. Its income fell a third short of projections in the first six months of this year. To raise money, the documents showed, ALEC considered expanding its policy portfolio to gambling, and, concerned about potential tax problems with its designation as a 501(c)(3) charity, it is considering 501(c)(4) status, which would allow it to lobby more openly.\\n\\nAmong the ALEC documents obtained by the Guardian: a draft loyalty oath for legislators who serve as the group’s state chairs, declaring that “I will act with care and loyalty and put the interests of the organization first.”\\n\\nWhen I first dealt with ALEC as a state government reporter 18 years ago, it was right of center but known for thoughtful policy research. But it adopted an aggressive agenda to pass legislation expanding gun rights and voter-identification requirements, and limit the reach of public-employee unions, social-welfare programs, consumer and environmental protections, and Obamacare.\\n\\nEmboldened by the Guardian report, liberal politicians held an anti-ALEC teleconference Wednesday afternoon. “ALEC,” said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), a former member of the group, “is nothing more than a corporate-funded and\\n\\n-dominated group that operates much like a dating service, only between legislators and special interests.”\\n\\nDanielle Conrad, a Nebraska state senator who quit ALEC, called it a “shadowy group” that made a “radical shift” in its agenda.\\n\\nAt the Grand Hyatt, Meierling, who joined ALEC from the United Way in January, told me that he’s gradually introducing transparency but that ALEC “can’t just kick the doors open.”\\n\\nActually, it can — unless it doesn’t want people to see what’s behind those doors.\\n\\nTwitter: @Milbank\\n\\nRead more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.'"

              " \"It's been two years since the net came together to raise funds to support Werner Koch, who maintains the absolutely vital GnuPG email encryption system, used daily by millions to protect the privacy and integrity of their email.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, Koch and the GnuPG foundation are trying to raise at least €15,000/month to fund three full-time developers to work on this piece of vital internet infrastructure -- they're hoping to shoot past that and hit €30,000/month, which would allow the project to support ancillary pieces of the GnuPG ecosystem like GPGTools.\\n\\nI've given $100.\\n\\nDue to a lack of contracts, Werner Koch, GnuPG's lead developer, was forced to lay off the only other person working on GnuPG full-time. And, by 2014, Werner had to take side jobs unrelated to GnuPG to supplement his income.\\n\\nThe situation looked so bad that Werner was ready to give up. But, friends convinced him to give a donation campaign one last shot. The response was amazing. Not only did he receive enough money to fund himself, but he pulled in 250 000 euros in small donations, and Stripe, Facebook and the Linux Foundation each committed to donating about 50 000 euros per year.\\n\\nGiven this amazing response, Werner decided to grow the team again. To date, he has hired 5 developers, and the past two years have seen a number of improvements to GnuPG and the surrounding ecosystem. For instance, we've worked on simplifying key discovery, adopted a set of Python bindings for GPG, contributed some improvements to Enigmail, and supported the Gnuk project—a free source and free hardware security token.\\n\\nWe want to continue this work in the long term. But, we want to do so in such a way that our first loyalty is unambiguously to the general public. This means making sure that a majority of our funding comes from individual donors, and not corporations. Further, to ensure long-term stability, our focus is on recurring donations and not one-time donations.\\n\\nOur primary goal is to get donation commitments for 15 000 euros per month—enough to fund 3 developers. We can reach this goal if just 2000 people donate 5 or 10 euros each month, the equivalent of just 2 or 3 cups of coffee.\",\n",
              " 'Joey Davidson | PAX East 2016 Gaming Reviews & News Interview by I took some time at PAX East 2016 this past weekend to check out Overwatch running on a PlayStation 4. The game plays really well, and you can dig into my impressions of it on that format right here. After my hands-on session, I sat down with Assistant Game Director Aaron Keller and talked about a bunch of stuff as it relates to the game. I’ve transcribed that interview in its entirety. My questions are in bold, Aaron’s answers are in plain text. Check it out below this gallery.\\n\\ngallery 1 27 Advertisement\\n\\nDid you need to make any design changes in order to accommodate bringing Overwatch to consoles? We talked about it, it was something we anticipated while developing the game… Even early on, we wanted to develop this game for consoles. Most of the team had console controllers on their desks even though they were hooked up to PCs and we didn’t have a console build yet. We wanted it to feel as good as it could on the console, and I feel like we accomplished that. I think it plays really well and handles really smoothly on console, and it’s always locked at 60fps. We had anticipated that we’d need to make a lot of tuning changes, and we didn’t actually have to do that. Really? That’s sort of surprising… There are very small differences, and I don’t think we have any on the tuning side right now. There are differences like voice chat, you know, because the consoles handle that. We do have aim assist on consoles, so that’s probably the biggest difference between the versions for gameplay. How does this aim assist work? I don’t have all the details of it, but we actually worked really closely with Treyarch [one of the studios behind Call of Duty]. They gave us a lot of tips for it, and a lot of help with tuning on it. They were actually really helpful all around. Is that sort of an unexpected perk of being with Activision now? Yeah, we’ve collaborated with a lot of different studios. We worked with Treyarch for our game, the Destiny team [Bungie] has come down multiple times to talk to different people at Blizzard. It’s actually… you know, a lot of people look at Activision as this dispersed set of studios, but there’s actually a lot of collaboration between them. Did that surprise you? A little bit when it first happened; but, it’s actually been really refreshing and really nice to feel like your part of this broader set of kick-ass developers.\\n\\ngallery 1 13 Advertisement\\n\\nSo, it’s 21 characters right now, right? Yep. How did you arrive at that number? Was there a lot cut out… I mean, I’m sure there was… Yeah, it was pretty fluid at the start of development, you know, exactly how many heroes we wanted to have in the game. One of the things that was really important to us was that we have a variety of play styles, and a variety of play styles within each role. We have four different roles in the game: attack, defense, support and tank. We wanted a lot of people to be able to feel like they could pick this support instead of another because it better fits their play style. Sure. We wanted there to be a lot of different options and counters for people to select from over the course of a match. 21 is where we had it. The interesting thing that happened during development is that even when we had 17 or 18 heroes, we would add a new one in and it would totally change the way the game was played. Did that mean that you would have to go back and re-tune all 17 of the previous heroes? That could happen, but some of it was almost just that the meta of the game would change because this new hero was there. There were new things that you would have to think about as you played the game. Does that sort of meta game change make it harder to decide on stuff like character DLC after launch? Yes and no. The game sort of reacts a little differently to each hero you throw at it. It’s always, from our point of few, become more interesting and more exciting each time we’ve done it. It’s always this refreshing thing that happens; the new heroes are there, and you’re thinking about everything. Whether it’s on a specific map or how your team should handle strategy, you’re thinking about everything in new and different ways. We have already talked about it. We will be adding new heroes to the game, and we will be adding new maps to the game. That stuff is coming.\\n\\ngallery 1 23 Advertisement',\n",
              " 'The U.S. House of Representatives has voted to continue the collection of hundreds of millions of Americans\\' phone records in the fight against terrorism.\\n\\nThe chamber rejected a measure to end the program\\'s authority, but it was unlikely to settle the debate over privacy rights and government efforts to thwart terrorism. The vote was 217-205 on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe vote marked the first chance for lawmakers to take a stand on the secret surveillance program since former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden leaked classified documents last month that spelled out the monumental scope of the government\\'s activities.\\n\\nRepublican Representative Justin Amash had challenged the program as an indiscriminate collection of phone records, saying his effort was to defend the U.S. Constitution and \"defend the privacy of every American.\"\\n\\nThe issue created unusual political coalitions in Washington, with the Obama administration, national security leaders in Congress and the Republican establishment facing off against libertarian-leaning conservatives and some liberal Democrats.\\n\\nThe measure faces strong opposition in the Senate and from the White House and is unlikely to survive in a final spending bill. Amash\\'s measure was offered as an addition to a $598.3 billion US defense spending bill for 2014.\\n\\n\"Have 12 years gone by and our memories faded so badly that we forgot what happened on Sept. 11?\" Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence committee, said in pleading with his colleagues to back the program.\\n\\nWith a flurry of letters, statements and tweets, both sides lobbied furiously in the hours prior to the vote in the Republican-controlled House. The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, warned against dismantling a critical intelligence tool.\\n\\nSince the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress has authorized — and a Republican and a Democratic president have signed — an extension of the powers to search records and conduct roving wiretaps in pursuit of terrorists.\\n\\nSince the disclosures this year, however, lawmakers have said they were shocked by the scope of the two programs — one to collect records of hundreds of millions of calls and the other allowing the NSA to sweep up internet usage data from around the world that goes through nine major U.S.-based providers.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve really gone overboard on the security side,\" said Representative Peter Welch of Vermont, who said it was time for a full debate on behalf of U.S. taxpayers about programs long cloaked in secrecy and part of an annual classified intelligence budget of about $30 billion.\\n\\nThe White House and the director of the NSA, Army Gen. Keith Alexander, made last-minute appeals to lawmakers, urging them to oppose the amendment. Eight former attorneys general, CIA directors and national security experts wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the two programs are fully authorized by law and \"conducted in a manner that appropriately respects the privacy and civil liberties interests of Americans.\"\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney issued an unusual statement on the eve of Wednesday\\'s vote, arguing that the change would \"hastily dismantle one of our intelligence community\\'s counterterrorism tools.\"\\n\\nProponents of the NSA programs argue that the surveillance operations have been successful in thwarting at least 50 terror plots across 20 countries, including 10 to 12 directed at the United States. Among them was a 2009 plot to strike at the New York Stock Exchange.\\n\\nThe overall defense spending bill would provide the Pentagon with $512.5 billion for weapons, personnel, aircraft and ships plus $85.8 billion for the war in Afghanistan for the next budget year.\\n\\nThe total, which is $5.1 billion below current spending, has drawn a veto threat from the White House, which argues that it would force the administration to cut education, health research and other domestic programs in order to boost spending for the Pentagon.',\n",

He’s right on track to where I thought he would be.”\\n\\nBut that doesn’t mean Berhalter will be rushing Pogatetz into the lineup.\\n\\n“Tyson, Michael, they’ve been doing a great job,” he said. “That makes the decision even more difficult.”\\n\\nHow is Berhalter weighing the decision on whether to replace one of his current backs with Pogatetz? He’s not.\\n\\n“That’s not in our thought process right now,” he said. “Our thought process is that Tyson and Michael are doing a great job, that’s one side of it. The other side is that we have to get Emanuel fit. I think they’re two almost unrelated things.”\\n\\nComplicating the matter further is Pogatetz’s position. He’s not a winger or a forward, who can come in as an impact sub.

              " 'WASHINGTON -- GOP House candidate Nan Hayworth released a new ad Wednesday featuring her son, who is gay, assuring voters that his mother is not an \"extremist.\"\\n\\n\"As a gay man, coming to terms with who I am wasn\\'t easy, but my parents love me for who I am and for whom I love,\" says her son, Will, in the ad. \"So when I hear vicious negative attacks against Nan Hayworth, I have to speak out. Nan Hayworth is no extremist. She\\'s my mom. She\\'s kind. She\\'s compassionate. She\\'s always been there for me. And she\\'ll always be there for you.\"\\n\\nHayworth is attempting to defeat Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.) in New York\\'s 18th District. Maloney, who is gay, ousted Hayworth from the seat in 2012.\\n\\nThe Human Rights Campaign, the nation\\'s largest organization advocating for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, was unimpressed with Hayworth\\'s new ad. In a statement, the group criticized Hayworth for her policy positions, saying that just because she has a gay son doesn\\'t mean she\\'s a champion of LGBT rights.\\n\\n\"Of course Nan Hayworth loves her gay son. That\\'s not what\\'s at issue here,\" said David Stacy, HRC\\'s government affairs director. \"The problem is her lack of support for legal protections provided by marriage for everyone else who isn\\'t lucky enough to be related to an elected official. When Nan Hayworth had the chance to be a true fighter for LGBT issues in Congress, she was AWOL.\"\\n\\nHRC added that while in office, Hayworth refused to support marriage equality when the group asked her to do so. She also did not sign on to legislation that would have repealed the federal ban on same-sex marriage, and did not back a bill that would have extended the immigration benefits that heterosexual couples receive to same-sex partners of U.S. citizens.\\n\\nBut she did earn praise from LGBT groups for signing on as a cosponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would bar workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. She also was one of the lawmakers who introduced the Tax Parity for Health Plan Beneficiaries Act to end the taxation of employer-provided health insurance for domestic partners. At the time, HRC put out a press release praising her bill.\\n\\nHayworth and Maloney recently met with the Poukeepsie Journal\\'s editorial board, and the issue of marriage equality came up. Hayworth said she supported the Supreme Court\\'s ruling this month that left in place lower court decisions legalizing same-sex marriage in a number of states. But she added that the \"federal government should not impose a definition\" of marriage, indicating that she still opposes marriage equality at the federal level.\\n\\nHayworth also said, however, that states should recognize same-sex marriages performed legally elsewhere.\\n\\n\"If you get married in one state, it should be honored in every other state,\" she said.\\n\\nMaloney responded that Hayworth was in favor of allowing states to deprive him and his husband of their rights.\\n\\n\"She supports the ability of states that now discriminate to continue to do so,\" he replied.\\n\\nIn the 112th Congress, Hayworth had a 71 percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign. While that score ranked her ahead of most of her GOP colleagues on LGBT rights, she came in below every Democratic member of the state\\'s congressional delegation.\\n\\nThis piece has been updated with additional information on Hayworth\\'s record on LGBT issues.\\n\\n*************************\\n\\nWhat\\'s happening in your district?

              " 'The year I moved away, George W. Bush stood beneath a “Mission Accomplished” banner on an aircraft carrier and declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq. Facebook hadn’t yet been turned into a company. The iPhone did not exist. I left before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, before Detroit went bankrupt. I missed the Great Recession (though I am still living the European translation of it). I missed most of the last two presidencies. I missed Brangelina.\\n\\nInstead, I witnessed from the other side the global forces that would bring profound changes to America. I visited industrial regions of southern China where the ground seemed to vibrate under the weight and bustle of all the countless new factories. Once iPhones had been invented, it was Chinese workers who assembled them. I watched Bangladeshi seamstresses stitch clothes sold at Walmart. American consumers benefited from the cheaper goods, but American manufacturers did not. Between January 2000 and December 2014, the United States lost roughly five million manufacturing jobs.\\n\\nThen I moved to Rome and watched the European Union grow ineffective and paralyzed, as the dream of a vibrant, unified Europe seemed to wither. Democracy was losing ground in Hungary and the Philippines; it had all but surrendered in Russia. Syria became a slaughterhouse. The Islamic State dispatched terrorists around the world. China’s politics became more oppressive, as President Xi Jinping cracked down on dissent and nurtured a Maoist-style cult of personality. Economic globalization was supposed to accelerate political liberalization around the world, but instead authoritarianism appeared to be on the rise. The West, it seemed, had failed to anticipate the possibility that globalization could contribute to the destabilization of — or pose a threat to — democracy, even in the United States.\\n\\nThis summer, I decided I wanted to explore this place that had become a foreign country to me. I didn’t understand what had happened since I left, why so many people seemed so disillusioned and angry. I planned a zigzag route, revisiting places where I once lived or worked, a 29-day sprint through 11 states (and four time zones). I knew I would be moving too fast to make any sweeping declaration about the state of America, and I wouldn’t ask people which presidential candidate they were voting for. I was more interested in why they were so anxious about the present and the future. I wanted to find out why the country was fragmenting rather than binding together. Most of all I wanted to see with my own eyes what had changed — and so much had changed.\\n\\nBy the time I arrived in Washington in late July, the notion that American democracy could come unmoored was not being easily laughed off. Before beginning my journey in earnest, I paid a visit to Patrick J. Buchanan at his white mansion near the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Northern Virginia. I’d thought of Buchanan often over the last year, as Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination. In 1992, I covered Buchanan during a campaign stop in Macomb County, outside Detroit, when he was a Republican insurgent running for president, the Trump of that era. He mocked Republican elites, denounced free trade and globalization, antagonized minorities and vowed to build a “Buchanan fence” along the Mexican border. Buchanan’s nostalgia for the era of white-majority America was often interpreted, not without cause, as barely concealed racism. He lost in 1992, and again in 1996 and 2000, but he always predicted that his issues and his angry coalition would endure.',\n",

              " '\\n\\nThe Citadel has concluded that cadets photographed wearing pillowcases in a manner reminiscent of Ku Klux Klan hoods did not mean to offend anyone, according to a Monday statement.\\n\\n“However,” said Lt. Gen. John Rosa, president of the public military college in South Carolina, “I am disappointed some recognized how it could be construed as such but didn’t stop it.”\\n\\nFourteen cadets were punished as a result of the investigation. The discipline ranges from “on-campus punishments” to two-semester dismissals from campus, The Citadel’s statement said.\\n\\nA photo of cadets in white pants and shirts wearing white pillowcases with eyeholes cut out sparked social media outrage on December 9. In the photo, which an upperclassman posted, the cadets are seen reading from sheets of paper, which The Citadel said Monday were lyrics sheets for Christmas songs.\\n\\nSeveral cadets reported to their leaders they had witnessed the event, and the cadet leaders reported the incident to a company tactical officer, who informed school administrators, The Citadel said.\\n\\nRosa launched an investigation the following morning, and eight cadets temporarily were suspended. After initial interviews, seven more cadets were investigated, the school said.\\n\\nThe investigation shows that several freshmen were told to report to an upperclassman’s room on numerous occasions after Thanksgiving break, where they were directed to sing Christmas carols in costume, the school said. It was the week before finals.\\n\\n“The freshmen used what they had close at hand, including pillowcases and other uniform items, in an attempt to dress as ‘Ghosts of Christmas Past,’ ” The Citadel statement said. “At the outset, not all of the freshmen understood that the costumes could be construed by some as offensive in nature. Those who did thought they could easily explain that they were only dressed as ghosts, and said they just needed to complete the skit so they could resume studying.”\\n\\nThe investigation’s findings mirror the results of a preliminary investigation. Rosa initially called the photo “disturbing” and said it wasn’t consistent with The Citadel’s values.\\n\\nIn Monday’s statement, he said, “While the skit had no ill intent, it did show poor judgment. It demonstrates that we must integrate an even higher level of diversity education into cadets’ daily activities, and into the already extensive leadership and ethics curriculum. We are working on that now.”\\n\\nThe cadets involved, he said, “now understand that the costumes could be considered offensive and hurtful to many.”\\n\\nRosa is creating a diversity task force, and cadets are already required to complete four years of leadership and ethics training, which includes lessons on racial sensitivity and ethical decision making, the school said.\\n\\nThe Citadel, founded in 1842, has about 2,300 undergraduates making up the Corps of Cadets, the school website says.',\n",

Therefore the issue lies in the translation of such data into meaningful, impactful resolutions that can be measured by on-field progress.\\n\\nThere's an opportunity for both sides of the analytical coin to learn and communicate more effectively.

His appearance will mark the third consecutive year that Hall, 28, will run America\\'s oldest marathon, one of the five commercial races of the World Marathon Majors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am excited to be part of the John Hancock elite team for the third year in a row,\" Hall said in a prepared statement referring to John Hancock Financial, the Boston-based insurance giant which provides the funding for the race\\'s elite fields. \"I can\\'t wait to be back in Hopkinton in April ready to test myself over the most historic marathon course in America. I love the Boston Marathon and hope that both my experience training on and racing in the Boston Marathon will lead to something very special in the 2011 race.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBoston will be the first marathon Hall will contest without the coaching of Terrence Mahon of the Mammoth Track Club. Hall left Mahon\\'s group to coach himself after withdrawing from the Bank of America Chicago Marathon last October citing fatigue and over-training. Under Mahon\\'s coaching, Hall broke the American record for the half-marathon in 2007 (59:43), set a USA marathon debut record of 2:08:24 in London in 2007, won the USA Olympic Trials marathon later that year in a championships record of 2:09:02, then became the first-ever American-born athlete to break the 2:07 barrier, clocking a 2:06:17 personal best at London in 2008. Hall, who also finished 10th at the Olympic Games marathon in Beijing, and remains the second-fastest American ever behind former world record holder Khalid Khannouchi.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt Boston, Hall has enjoyed qualified successes. In his first attempt on the hilly course from Hopkinton to Boston\\'s Back Bay in 2009, the Stanford graduate did much of the leading in the first half of the race, fell all the way back to 9th place in the race\\'s middle stages, but battled back in the hills of Newton to finish third in 2:09:40. In 2010, Hall was again up front early, fell back, but rallied to finish fourth in 2:08:41, the best time ever run by an American in Boston. He was, however, well behind the winners Deriba Merga of Ethiopia (2009) and Robert Kiprono Cheruiyot (2001) both years.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn American man has not won the Boston Marathon since 1983 when Greg Meyer prevailed in 2:09:01. But the resurgence in USA marathon running in the last ten years has at least put Americans in contention again. American men have cracked the top-5 in three of the last five editions of the race (two in 2010, one in 2009 and three in 2006). Hall has done it twice, and clearly finds Boston\\'s traditions alluring.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Regardless of the day\\'s results, all of us who take on the unique journey of covering the 26.2 trying miles to Boylston Street can all say we partook in history,\" Hall concluded. \"I am training with eager anticipation for the opportunity that the Boston Marathon offers, believing that all things are possible.

              " 'Mets general manager Sandy Alderson met with the media in New York today to address a number of topics, including health updates on starters Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz, each of whom was reported to have a bone spur in his pitching elbow yesterday. Per Newsday’s Marc Carig (links to Twitter), Alderson said that club doctors aren’t worried about the spur in Syndergaard’s right elbow becoming worse, and the New York Post’s Mike Puma tweets that Syndergaard’s spur is much smaller than the spur in Matz’s elbow. Accordingly, the outlook on Matz was painted a bit more grimly, with Alderson somewhat stating, “He’ll either pitch and be able to tolerate the discomfort, or he won’t.” As Puma tweets, surgery to remove the spur would sideline Matz for three months, so he’ll look to continue pitching for the time being.\\n\\nMatz won’t need to be skipped on a regular basis, though, tweets ESPN New York’s Adam Rubin. However, the team might eventually move to a six-man rotation. Presumably, said mix would include right-hander Zack Wheeler, though Alderson said that while he’ll soon have a new projection for Wheeler’s return, he does not have a new one at this tme (via Carig). Logan Verrett is another option to get some starts, and he’ll take the hill Wednesday in place of Matz, as Matz will be bumped back to Thursday, per Rubin.\\n\\nThe rotation, of course, is far from the only area in which the Mets are dealing with injuries. First baseman Lucas Duda hasn’t suited up for a game since May 20 due to a stress fracture in his back, and he’s still at least two weeks away from even resuming baseball activities (Twitter link via MLB.com’s Anthony DiComo). As such, the earliest possible return date for Duda would seem to be August.\\n\\nLooking across the diamond, David Wright’s season could very well be over following neck surgery, and Alderson confirmed that the club worked out Cuban star Yulieski Gurriel, who could seemingly step in as an eventual alternative to the Mets’ longtime captain. Gurriel didn’t face live pitching in his workout, but he did run “fairly well,” per Alderson, and he also took batting practice and worked out in the field at both third base and second base (links to Carig on Twitter). They’re still weighing whether to make an offer, DiComo tweets, and it should be stressed that Gurriel is by no means an immediate replacement; it’s been months since Gurriel saw regular action in a game setting, and as such he’d need to spend a month ramping up in the minor leagues, in the Mets’ estimation.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the Mets have enlisted a different infield alternative by bringing Jose Reyes back to Queens on a minor league deal. He’s working exclusively at third base in the minors, according to Alderson, but upon his promotion to the big leagues he’ll begin working out in the outfield as well (via Rubin). The addition of Reyes doesn’t in any way preclude the team from signing Gurriel as well, Carig notes. Of course, the Mets will have to deal with a number of other clubs should they elect to make a serious run at Gurriel. He’s reportedly worked out for the heavy-spending Dodgers already, and he’s also been connected to the likes of the Astros, Giants and Yankees in recent weeks since being declared a free agent by MLB.',\n",

Update (C) loadouts to be compatible with the weapon quirks being put in place2. Have community voting on the exact loadouts so we can avoid having poorly placed ammo, unpopular/ineffective weapons, and XL engines in mechs that are not generally considered smart to put XL's in (this is subjective to community opinion of course)3. Have a review set up semi-yearly (basically every 6 months) to take into account balance changes, changes in community thinking, and general 'dust off' of ineffective or low effectiveness (C) builds to keep a fresh and effective level of (C) mechs for new and experienced players alike.Current list of (C) mechs for IS;Spider - SDR 5K(C)Firestarter - FS9-S(C)Jenner - JR7-F(C)Cicada - CDA-2A(C)Blackjack - BJ-1(C)Centurion - CN9-A(C)Hunchback - HBK-4P(C)Trebuchet - TBT-7M(C)Kintaro - KTO-18(C)Shadowhawk - SHD-2H(C)Dragon - DRG-5N(C)Quickdraw - QKD-4G(C)Catapult - CPLT-A1(C)Cataphract - CTF-3D(C)Orion - ON1-K(C)Victor - VTR-9S(C)Stalker - STK-3F(C)Highlander - HGN-733C(C)Atlas - AS7-RS(C)I am not requesting this right out the gate, as we will need to see the effectiveness of various loadouts once the dust settles. I suggest a January or February date barring any exceptional changes to the tier list so that we can get relevant and functional builds on these champion mechs. All in all the community can shoulder most of the 'what do we put in it' work and the development cost is just changing the loadouts in the code and reaping the data from the community (which is fairly light weight all things considered). In exchange for this time investment PGI gets a stronger new player experience, more reputable (C) mechs which encourage player retention since they do not feel unable to find a suitable mech with 'try before you buy', and more functional (C) mechs overall for all players.Further, with a semi-annual review/update if mechs are found to be just fine overall, they do not need to be considered for a particular update with a simple metric evaluation and community up/down vote. This allows additional (C) mechs to be added down the line without seriously increasing workload as time goes on.Edit - added the new Trebuchet champion\\n\\nEdited by Monky, 07 October 2014 - 12:06 PM.\",\n",

In one clip the mother beaver appears to be giving the kit a tour of the river, holding the young animal carefully in her jaws. In a second, a young beaver appears not to be too keen on swimming and heads speedily back to the bank.\\n\\nWild beavers seen in England for first time in centuries Read more\\n\\nBuckley said: “When I saw these new born baby beavers I was totally overwhelmed and thought it must be a miracle. My first sighting of this year’s new born kits was when I saw their mother swimming with one of them in her mouth to an area nearby where their father was waiting to greet them.\\n\\n“One of the kits, however, seemed extremely unhappy to be out in the big wide world and as soon as its mother let it go it rushed back to its burrow. Not surprising really – the world can be a very scary place. This was possibly their first experience of what lies outside of their burrow.”\\n\\nA population of beavers was first confirmed on the River Otter in February 2014. This was the first time that breeding beavers were known to be living in the English countryside in as much as 400 years.\\n\\nIn summer 2014 the department for environment, food and rural affairs expressed its intention to remove the animals, citing fears that they might be carrying a disease.\\n\\nDevon Wildlife Trust built a partnership of supportive local landowners, academic institutions and beaver veterinary and management experts to suggest creating a wild beaver monitoring project.\\n\\nIt captured the beavers to check if they were healthy and re-released them into the wild. The trust now believes there are at least 11 beavers in the river – including the two babies – but believes there could be as many as 15.\\n\\nDevon Wildlife Trust’s Mark Elliott said: “We are thrilled that the beavers have bred. The baby kits appear fit and healthy and the adults seem as if they are taking their parenting responsibilities very seriously. It tells us that the beavers are very much at home in this corner of Devon.\\n\\n“The slowly expanding population of these wild animals will help us to gain valuable insights into beavers and their environment – both in terms of animal behaviour and any benefits and effects on the surrounding river system.”\\n\\nRewilding Britain: bringing wolves, bears and beavers back to the land Read more\\n\\nElliott also asked people not to disturb the beavers. “The beavers have proved enormously popular with local people and we understand that many will now want to see the kits for themselves. But like all new parents, the beavers will need a bit of space and peace at this time. So we ask that visitors take care not to disturb them. This means remaining on public footpaths, keeping a respectful distance from them, and keeping dogs under close control, especially when near the river.”\\n\\nHe said that beavers give birth to an average of three kits and not all kits would make it to adulthood, so an expansion of the River Otter beaver population would be steady rather than rapid.',\n",
              " \"Scarborough needs light rapid transit, UTSC experts say\\n\\nOpening day in March, 1985 for the Scarborough RT train. A new report on transit options by U of T Scarborough Professor André Sorensen shows LRT along major east-west arterial roads make the most sense given Scarborough’s urban makeup. (photo by Robert Taylor via Flickr)\\n\\nLRT along major east-west arterial roads make the most sense for Scarborough’s urban makeup, according to a new report on rapid transit options from the University of Toronto.\\n\\n“A critical aspect that’s been neglected in recent debates on transit investments in Scarborough is the potential for land redevelopment and intensification in areas near proposed transit stations,” said U of T Scarborough ProfessorAndré Sorensen, who authored the 42-page report along with U of T Associate Professor Paul Hess.\\n\\n(Read the report: Choices for Scarborough: Transit, Walking and Intensification in Toronto's Inner Suburbs.)\\n\\nThe pair mapped land use, street networks, pedestrian access to transit stops and development potential in the corridors that could be served by the different rapid transit options under consideration for Scarborough. They suggest that building a high-capacity rapid transit line in low-intensity suburban areas only makes sense if it’s possible to redevelop and intensify lands within walking distance of the transit stops.\\n\\n“The best opportunities for redevelopment exist along Scarborough’s east-west arterials, such as Eglinton and Sheppard, because they have large lots, wide property frontages and currently have low intensity of land use,” said Sorensen, an urban geographer known for his studies of urban regeneration in cities such as Tokyo.\\n\\nToronto’s suburbs were originally designed to resist gradual change in residential areas, notes Sorensen. There are rules against intensification and, even today, suggestions of redevelopment are often met with strong opposition from residents. As a result, few areas provide opportunities for significant redevelopment.\\n\\nSorensen and Hess conclude that LRT lines such as those proposed by Transit City are not only cheaper and faster to build than a subway, they also offer greater potential for spurring much-needed reinvestment in the area.\\n\\nBy comparison the city council’s plan to build the Scarborough subway extension from Kennedy to Sheppard Avenue would be expensive, accessible to far fewer potential riders from the surrounding neighbourhoods and offer much lower potential for redevelopment along the corridor.\\n\\n“LRT offers a longer set of lines and is a much better fit with the existing landscape in Scarborough, including both where the population is and where the jobs are today and where they will likely grow in the future through redevelopment and intensification,” said Sorensen\\n\\nThe report also says rapid transit planning has become intensely political, focusing too narrowly on routes, ridership capacity and the projected cost of various lines while neglecting important elements of how areas such as Scarborough were developed, which “sets the stage” for development and transit opportunities.\\n\\n“Understandably there is considerable pressure to just start building something, but it’s more important to get these decisions right,” said Hess. “These investments will cost billions of dollars and will profoundly shape the future of urban development and potentially improve the quality of life for many who live in this area of the city.”\\n\\nThe top priority for Scarborough transit should be the Sheppard LRT, say Sorensen and Hess, who stress that it should begin construction right away.\\n\\n“The Sheppard LRT outperforms all of the potential lines in terms of the number of residents, jobs and pedestrian network per kilometre of track,” said Hess. “It’s already been approved with environmental assessments and would be able to start carrying passengers even before construction starts on either of the two existing proposals.”\",\n",

And Kurdish forces have claimed that militants affiliated with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, used a chlorine-based chemical in at least one suicide truck bomb in Iraq this year.\\n\\nFiring chemical mortar shells across distances, however, as opposed to dispersing toxic chemicals via truck bombs or stationary devices, would be a new tactic for the group, and would require its munitions makers to overcome a significantly more difficult technical challenge.',\n",
              " 'Racial and educational splits are changing the old map rapidly.\\n\\nThere are two emerging post-election story lines about partisan battlegrounds that will mess up the neat red-state/blue-state maps political junkies carry around in their heads. The ultimate dimensions of the presidential contest will determine which one we are all gabbing about on November 9 — assuming we aren’t instead freaking out over hacked returns or civil unrest.\\n\\nIf Hillary Clinton builds on her current advantage and blows out to something approaching a double-digit lead in the national popular vote, she will likely win all the battleground states (loosely defined as including Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania). The big news might be that she could also carry Arizona and Georgia, which would be a sign that certain pro-Democratic demographic trends are arriving a bit earlier than expected. In this scenario, Texas could be close as well. An outcome like that would be a boon not only to Democrats, but to those Republicans who argue that any Trump-style white nationalist appeal is demographically doomed, even if a champion for it can be found who does not fatally alienate college-educated white women.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, the presidential race stays reasonably competitive going down the stretch, it is looking more and more like Trump’s appeal to non-college-educated white voters and the angst he creates among minority and/or college-educated voters will reshape the traditional map. David Wasserman describes the change succinctly:\\n\\nIn 1996, Bill Clinton carried Iowa, Missouri and Ohio on his way to re-election, while losing Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia. Twenty years later, Hillary Clinton’s path to 270 electoral votes is more likely to do the opposite.\\n\\nIt’s not that complicated, really. The percentage of the electorate represented by non-college-educated white voters is 62 percent in Iowa and 53 percent in Ohio and Missouri (it’s also 57 percent in Wisconsin, which could win up being closer than we expect). It’s 42 percent in Colorado, 40 percent in North Carolina, and 37 percent in Virginia (it’s also 34 percent in Georgia, which is why that state is vulnerable to a big Democratic margin nationally). The more the balance of the electorate is composed of minorities rather than college-educated whites, the stronger the resistance to Trump seems to be.\\n\\nWe also are beginning, as Politico reports today, to see early voting trends that reinforce this new map:\\n\\nIn two must-win states for Trump, North Carolina and Florida, Republicans are clinging to narrow leads in the total number of mail-in ballots requested. Yet in both states, Clinton is ahead of President Barack Obama’s pace four years earlier — and the GOP trails Mitt Romney’s clip.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny diminishment of the GOP’s mail-in ballot lead is a matter of concern for Republicans because Democrats typically dominate early in-person voting in both states, which will begin over the next 10 days.\\n\\nVirginia does not really have early voting, and Colorado’s virtually all-mail-ballot system is not easy to assess at this stage. But North Carolina and Florida are behaving about as you might expect in the case of a small national lead for Clinton. So, too, are Iowa and Ohio:\\n\\n[T]here are undercurrents that should cause concern for the Democratic nominee. The party’s early-vote performance in Midwestern states like Iowa and Ohio appears to be well behind its 2012 pace. And it could be a signal that, while Democrats may be gaining strength up and down the East Coast, they could be losing steam in states Obama won twice, like Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin.\\n\\nIf that’s the way it ultimately shakes out, pro-Trump Republicans will have a better case to make that Trump had a path to victory via states Obama won twice, but was stabbed in the back by perfidious Establishment Republicans and knifed straight-on by the biased globalist media.\\n\\nA more worrisome possibility is that if Clinton beats Trump in a particularly strong performance among minority voters in states like Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, we’ll hear more than the usual amount of odious BS about “voter fraud.” In that contingency, we can only hope such arguments are made peacefully after Trump has conceded to Clinton.',\n",

Weapons design is no exception.\\n\\nA group of Quora users sought to answer the question, \"What are some historical weapons that most people have never heard of?\" The answers provide amazing insight into the history of war, and offer examples of some of the most ingenious — yet impractical — weaponry ever created.\\n\\nWe\\'ve highlighted some of the most interesting below.\\n\\n1. The Bat Bomb\\n\\nWikimedia Commons\\n\\nDeveloped by the US for use against Japan during World War II, the bat bomb was literally that. Each bomb would contain 40 hibernating bats, each of which would be strapped with a small napalm bomb and a timer.\\n\\nThe bombs could deploy their own parachutes, giving the bats time to fly out and look for places to roost. They would then explode, potentially burning down whatever structure they had chosen as their new home.\\n\\n2. Anti-Tank Dogs\\n\\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:F_ww2_sov16.jpg The Nazi betrayal of the Soviets during World War II caught the Russians completely off guard. In a desperate attempt at staving off the Nazi advance into their territory, the Soviets strapped dogs with explosives and trained them to run under German tanks.\\n\\nSoviet propaganda claims that around 300 German tanks were destroyed in this manner. The anti-tank dog program continued until 1996.\\n\\n3. Submarine Aircraft Carriers\\n\\nJapanese Navy At the height of World War II, the Imperial Japanese Navy commissioned a series of Sen Toku I-400 class submarines. These subs were large enough to carry three Aichi M6A Seiran aircraft underwater, surface and launch the planes, and then dive again. The submarines were also equipped with torpedoes.\\n\\nA total of three of them were completed.\\n\\n4. Nuclear Artillery\\n\\nUS Department Of Energy\\n\\nConventional nuclear weapons are capable of destroying entire cities, but during the Cold War, the idea of \\'tactical\\' nuclear weapons emerged. These smaller nukes were limited-yield weapons that would be launched from the ground at targets on the battlefield. Nuclear artillery was delivered with shells and short-range rockets.\\n\\n5. The Soviet Ekranoplane\\n\\nIgor 113\\n\\nThe 300-foot-long Lun-class Ekranoplane flew a mere four meters above the ground or water through an effect generated by its wings. It was intended to be a revolutionary transport vessel, bigger than any plane and faster than any ship. It was also capable of carrying nuclear warheads.\\n\\nBut it never entered into wide production and was never used in action.\\n\\n6. Kaiten Torpedoes\\n\\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kaiten_Type_1_on_display_at_the_Y%C5%ABsh%C5%ABkan_in_October_2008.JPG Kaiten torpedoes were built by the Imperial Japanese Navy and were in service between 1944 and 1945. These torpedoes were manned and were a variant of the suicide weapons that Japan resorted to towards the end of the war. The torpedoes were launched from submarines and the pilots of the torpedoes could steer the weapons as necessary to inflict maximum damage against an enemy.\\n\\n7. Pigeon-Guided Missiles\\n\\nDepartment of Defense\\n\\nPigeon-guided missiles were developed by noted behaviorist B.F. Skinner during Project Pigeon. Although the project was ultimately cancelled because of the impracticality of the weapons, the idea of pigeon-guided missiles showed promise.\\n\\nThe missile had an array of lenses at the front that projected an image of the target to an interior screen. The pigeons were conditioned to peck at the target on the screen. The pigeon\\'s pecks corrected the missile\\'s flight path.',\n",

The law [full English translation here] establishes procedures for foreign organizations to register formally and conduct activities in China. The law puts NGOs under the supervision of Public Security Departments under China’s State Council, giving these organs broad powers to control NGOs’ personnel decisions, programs, and grant-making, even giving them apparently unrestricted access to the organizations’ computers and bank accounts. Additionally, the law would impose a variety of restrictions on Chinese non-profits that receive money from overseas.

              " 'There\\'s been a rich debate in marine ecological circles about what happens to a key food source along rocky coastlines dominated by upwelling. The literature is filled with studies suggesting that the larvae of simple prey organisms such as barnacles and mussels hitch a ride on the coast-to-offshore currents typical of upwelling and are thus mostly absent in the coastal tidal zones.\\n\\nThat theory is getting a major challenge. In a paper in Ecological Monographs, Brown University marine ecologist Jon Witman and colleagues report that a key thread in the food web, the barnacle -- the popcorn of the sea -- flourishes in zones with vertical upwelling. Working at an expansive range of underwater sites in the Galapagos Islands, Witman and his team found that at two subtidal depths, barnacle larvae had latched onto rock walls, despite the vertical currents. In fact, the swifter the vertical current, the more likely the barnacles would colonize a rocky surface, the team found.\\n\\nThe finding \"is counter to the prevailing notion about how marine communities are influenced by upwelling,\" said Witman, professor of biology in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.\\n\\nBarnacle communities thrived in the vertical-current sites, the team also found. The group routinely found specimens that had grown from one field season to the next to 3 centimeters (about 1 inch) in diameter -- \"big enough to make soup out of,\" Witman said. The researchers also documented the presence of whelks and hogfish, which feast on barnacles. This predator-prey relationship shows that vertical upwelling zones are \"much more dynamic ecosystems in terms of marine organisms than previously believed,\" Witman said.\\n\\nProfessor of Biology Witman and his team, including Brown graduate student Margarita Brandt and Franz Smith of CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research in Australia, chose a dozen sites of underwater cliffs, ledges and slopes along a 125-kilometer-long transect in the Galapagos. During three field seasons, the team bolted nearly 1,500 plates at depths of 6 and 15 meters to track the colonization of barnacle larvae and the growth of populations in areas with weak, intermediate and strong vertical upwelling.\\n\\nThe team also documented for the first time the strength of currents at the sampling locations, which included a dozen islands or outcrops located in the center of the archipelago. In areas with the most vertical upwelling, the researchers found, the current moved at a brisk 0.6 meters (2 feet) per second; the weakest vertical currents were measured at 5 centimeters (0.2 feet) per second.\\n\\nScientists who study coastal marine communities had assumed that prey species such as barnacles and mussels would be largely absent in vertical upwelling areas, since the larvae, which float freely in the water as they seek a surface to attach to, would more likely be swept away in the coast-to-offshore currents. Studies of the near-surface layer of the water in rocky tidal zones confirmed that thinking. But the field work by Witman and his group, in deeper water than previous studies, told a different tale: Few barnacles were found on the plates in the weak upwelling zones, while plates at the strong upwelling sites were teeming with the crustaceans. Flourishing barnacle communities were found at both the 6-meter and 15-meter stations, the researchers reported.\\n\\nThe scientists think the free-floating larvae thrive in the vertical-current zones because they are constantly being bounced against the rocky walls and eventually find a tranquil spot in micro crevices in the rock to latch on to. \"It\\'s a contact game,\" Witman said.\\n\\nThe team suggests the observations could hold true for other rocky tidal ecosystems. \"We\\'re one of the few people doing underwater experimental ecology in the Galapagos,\" said Brandt, who is Ecuadorean. \"This project is one of the first attempts to do that.\"\\n\\nThe National Science Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the private Banks Foundation funded the research.',\n",

              " 'Share\\n\\nWho hasn’t gotten part of the way through a bowl of cereal only to discover that the milk has gone off? Thankfully, researchers at Purdue University and the University of Tennessee are helping avert such traumatic starts to our morning with a new, non-chemical treatment that promises to extend regular milk’s shelf life to around 2-3 weeks — and without affecting the nutrients or flavor.\\n\\nThe technology they’ve developed involves increasing the temperature of milk by just 10 degrees for less than a second. For those keeping track at home, that’s well below the 70-degree Celsius threshold needed for pasteurization. Even so, the quick heat blast eliminates more than 99 percent of the bacteria left behind after pasteurization.\\n\\n“The developed technology uses low temperature, short time (LTST) in a process that disperses milk in the form of droplets with low heat/pressure variation over a short treatment time in conjunction with pasteurization,” Bruce Applegate, Purdue’s associate professor in the Department of Food Science, explained to Digital Trends. “The resultant product was subjected to a taste panel and participants had equal or greater preference for the LTST pasteurized milk compared to normally pasteurized milk. The shelf was determined to be a minimum of two weeks longer than the standard shelf life from pasteurization alone.”\\n\\nSo is this some fascinating research project which won’t hit shelves for the foreseeable future? Apparently not. “Currently an Ohio-based milk processor is using this technology and distributing the milk,” Applegate says. “The unit is approved for processing milk in Ohio and distribution nationwide. The product is currently being distributed, however it has not been labeled as extended shelf life milk. Once the commercial application is validated the milk will be labelled with the extended shelf life.”\\n\\nSorry Louis Pasteur, you may have met your match. And we no longer have to fear our housemates’ penchant for keeping ten-day-old milk hanging around the apartment…',\n",
              " \"The Hull-Ottawa fire of 1900 was a devastating fire in 1900 that destroyed much of Hull, Quebec, and large portions of Ottawa, Ontario. On April 26 a defective chimney on a house in Hull caught fire, which quickly spread between the wooden houses due to windy conditions.[1] Along the river were the large lumber companies, and huge amounts of stacked lumber that quickly ignited.[2]\\n\\nTwo thirds of Hull was destroyed, including 40 per cent of its residential buildings and most of its largest employers along the waterfront. The fire also spread across the Ottawa River, carried by wind borne embers and destroyed a large swath of western Ottawa from the Lebreton Flats south to Dow's Lake. About one fifth of Ottawa was destroyed [3] with almost everything in the band between Booth Street and the rail line levelled.\\n\\nPrevailing wind patterns and the higher elevation of central Ottawa prevented the fire from spreading east. The fire break created by the rail line also preserved the Hintonburg area. The fire engines 'The Conqueror' and 'La France' had to be abandoned to the flames, and the call went out to five communities for assistance in fighting the blaze, including Montreal and Toronto. Montreal was able to send a fire engine by rail, which arrived in less than two hours. Dynamiting houses to block the fire's spread was considered, but this plan was rejected in view of the danger that falling debris from the blast would only spread the conflagration further.[4]\\n\\nExtent of fire\\n\\nSeven people were killed in the blaze, and fifteen thousand were made homeless, including 14% of the population of Ottawa and 42% of Hull's population.[5] Property losses amounted to $6,200,000 in Ottawa and $3,300,000 in Hull, with insurance covering 50% of the damage in Ottawa but only 23% of the damage in Hull.[5] More were killed by disease in the densely packed tent cities where the people were forced to live afterwards. Worldwide response to the disaster generated $957,000 in aid, including $4.86 from distant Chile.[6]\\n\\nLegacy [ edit ]\\n\\nA Souvenir photo views of the big fire, Ottawa & Hull, April 26, 1900, was produced.[7] A postcard was produced showing the aftereffects of the Ottawa Hull Fire of April 26, 1900, with a view of The Hotel Cecil on the south side of Wellington Street in Ottawa.[8]\\n\\nThe Hull-Ottawa fire\\n\\nSee also [ edit ]\\n\\nReferences [ edit ]\\n\\nCoordinates:\",\n",

              " 'As part of his deeply unfortunate response to the latest terror attack in London, Donald Trump declared his intention to “get down to the business of security for our people.” He then went golfing for a few hours.\\n\\nBefore hitting the links, the president didn’t specify what getting down to business would entail, exactly, but if Trump had a director of the FBI, it’d be a helpful step in the right direction.\\n\\nIt’s been nearly a month since the president fired then-FBI Director James Comey because of Trump’s concerns about the counter-espionage investigation Comey was leading, and as is too often the case, the White House hadn’t lined up a successor before making the move.\\n\\nFour days after the firing, Trump pledged to move quickly to nominate a new director. A few days after that, the president said he was “very close” to announcing Comey’s replacement.\\n\\nAnd yet, here were are, more than two weeks later, waiting for an announcement. Reuters reported the other day that the process of finding a new director isn’t going especially well in part because of the president’s role.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump is still looking for a new FBI director more than three weeks after he fired James Comey, and sources familiar with the recruiting process say it has been chaotic and that job interviews led by Trump have been brief. […] Those conversations, which followed initial interviews at the Justice Department, have been light on questions about substantive issues facing the agency, the three associates said.\\n\\nAccording to Reuters’ reporting, one prospective director reportedly described the process as “chaotic” and said that in one interview, “Trump spoke mostly about himself and seemed distracted.”\\n\\nThat’s very easy to believe. By all appearances, the president has no meaningful understanding of what an FBI director does, so the fact that he’s involved in the interview process is bound to be a hindrance.\\n\\nI just hope Trump doesn’t hand copies of the 2016 electoral map to those under consideration.\\n\\nPart of the challenge goes beyond simply finding the right person for the job; it also involves someone who actually wants the job. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) was under consideration, but withdrew. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) soon after did the same thing.\\n\\nThe fact that these three were even considered was odd – we’ve never had a politician serve as a permanent FBI director before – but I imagine Trump was looking for someone he’s seen on television, and those with lengthy careers in federal law enforcement are less widely recognized.',\n",
              " 'WARNING: Spoilers ahead for “Game of Thrones” Season 7.\\n\\nOne bit of Valyrian steel keeps cropping up around “Game of Thrones” this season: the dagger used in the attempt on Bran’s (Isaac Hempstead Wright) life in Season 1.\\n\\nLet’s quickly recap: After being pushed out of a window, the young Stark was attacked in his recovery bed by a hired assassin who ends up getting mauled by Bran’s direwolf, Summer (RIP). His mother, Catelyn (Michelle Fairley), then takes the distinctive blade to her husband at King’s Landing, where Littlefinger (Aiden Gillen) claims it originally belonged to him but that he lost it in a bet with Tyrion (Peter Dinklage). Thing is, honesty is the last quality Littlefinger is known for.\\n\\nWith a black tapered handle and blood-red stone topping off a curved blade, the dagger ― sometimes called “catspaw” for its association with the assassin ― is a fairly wicked-looking instrument.\\n\\nAnd the foreshadowing is strong with this one: HBO Nordic featured the weapon in a cheeky teaser for Season 7 alongside the words “be prepared” on its Facebook page. It was also featured prominently on Arya’s (Maisie Williams) hip in Season 7 promotional images for Entertainment Weekly, suggesting it’ll end up in her care.\\n\\nEntertainment Weekly\\n\\nBut last we know, the dagger was still in the possession of Littlefinger. And in the Episode 4 trailer, we see what appear to be his hands unsheathing the blade. (Catch the full trailer above.)\\n\\nAlthough the shot is dark, the rings appear to be the ones Littlefinger is shown wearing earlier in the series. The sleeve styling appears similar to that favored by Littlefinger, too.\\n\\nHBO A shot from Episode 4, above, looks a lot like Littlefinger, below.\\n\\nIf the blade changes hands, some fans wonder whether that might spell the end for Littlefinger, whose betrayal of Ned Stark (Sean Bean) in Season 1 isn’t widely known at the moment.\\n\\nThere are a few good reasons to believe his time is now running out. Even though his knights saved the day during the Battle of the Bastards, Sansa (Sophie Turner) clearly doesn’t have much love for Littlefinger after the whole Ramsay thing. Bran has also returned to Winterfell with his newfound ability to see into the past and present, worldwide, making it pretty clear that he’s been doing some off-camera exploring. If he discovers Littlefinger’s past scheming, he could pass on that knowledge to his assassin sister Arya, who may make her return in Episode 4. (It sure looks like Arya is looking out onto Winterfell from horseback at the end of the teaser.)\\n\\nAnother detail in the show suggests the dagger will do some damage: It shows up in a book Sam was reading at the Citadel in the Season 7 premiere. As Samwell Tarly actor John Bradley told HuffPost earlier this month, viewers are meant to notice it ― he was told to linger on that page during the shoot.\\n\\nAside from its obvious power to enact vengeance, the dagger might also prove useful in the war to come. Valyrian steel is one of few things that can kill White Walkers, which we observed when Jon (Kit Harington) killed a Walker with his Valyrian sword, Longclaw. (Dragonglass also gets the job done.)\\n\\nWe like the idea of Arya having some at her side, just like her big brother ― er, cousin. Aww.',\n",

              " 'I try to explain, as mildly as I can, that my having Jewish friends doesn’t signify the end of the grim state of affairs in the region. I point out that, historically, Arabs and Jews actually lived pretty well together. In spite of rhetoric to the contrary, the Mideast crisis isn’t a case of why-can’t-they-just-get-along. It isn’t about ethnic differences. It isn’t hummus vs. hoummous.\\n\\nSometimes, instead of a pleased-and-patronizing outsider, I find myself confronted with sneaky, lurking, real anti-Semites who unabashedly come out of the woodwork when they hear that I’m Palestinian. “Hey, wanna hear a good one?” a stranger will ask conspiratorially. I cut him off before he finishes his joke, as soon as I can tell where it’s headed. “Dude,” I say. “You have no idea how badly you’ve misread this situation.”\\n\\nIt’s not just that I get how hurtful this type of discrimination can be. As both a Palestinian and an Arab in a post-9/11 world, I’ve been on the receiving end of it. It’s not even just because I can picture the faces of the Jews I know and love, for whom those jokes would strike deep and painfully resonant chords.\\n\\nThere’s another reason I despise these jokes. The Jews I meet might assume that I sympathize with the bomb-wielding extremists who want to push Israel into the sea. (To be clear: I do not.) But these closet anti-Semites assume that I sympathize with a species of historically European anti-Semitism —the kind that involves jokes about Jews hoarding money and controlling the media, the kind that involves big noses and black hats, the kind that led to the Jews’ persecution in the West. And those canards have nothing to do with Palestinians.\\n\\nIn fact, it was this very discrimination and irrational hatred that drove the need for a safe Jewish homeland, after Theodor Herzl anticipated the deadly turn the already-rampant European anti-Semitism would take. It is this continued anti-Semitism that apparently vindicates Israel’s most segregationist policies, invoking fears from centuries of persecution.\\n\\nMoreover, unjustified hatred of the Jewish people reduces any criticism of Israel’s practices to mere bigotry. There are concrete reasons to be at odds with Israel, reasons that include arbitrary arrests, evictions, settlements, and harassment, and simply the fact that most Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem aren’t recognized as voting citizens. Anti-Semitism—whether imported or home-grown—shatters those reasons into splinters of irrational fear.\\n\\nTo lump the Palestinian struggle—for human rights, for recognition, for nationality—in with an age-old prejudice isn’t reductionist; it’s downright absurd. In one fell swoop, a misguided bigot can manage to invoke the very sentiment that forced Jews out of Europe; make me, a Palestinian, part of the same anti-Semitism that led to Israel’s creation; and diminish all legitimate criticism of Israel to a species of European Jew-hating. It would almost be artful, if it weren’t so depressing.',\n",

              " 'On Monday, the Real Clear Politics site declared that Texas is up for grabs in the presidential election. The shift comes after a series of polls showing a tight race in the state between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and makes for a dramatic image on the site’s election tracking map, where Texas is no longer colored its usual red but is now the dark gray that connotes a “toss up.” For Democrats, seeing their state change color on one of the most widely read and respected campaign outlets—after decades of Republican dominance and years of unfulfilled hopes that Texas might turn blue—must be cathartic. And it might be tempting to view this sudden shift to competitiveness as the start of Democrats’ long-hoped-for return to relevance, as a turning point.\\n\\nWell, they should keep the cork in the champagne, because Texas remains a Republican state.\\n\\nAs my colleague R.G. Ratcliffe pointed out , the Texas polls are close not because of a huge spike in Democratic voters—Clinton’s numbers are roughly in line with Obama’s totals from 2008 and 2012—but because Trump’s support has cratered. He’s drastically under-performing previous Republican presidential nominees. John McCain and Mitt Romney garnered 55 percent and 57 percent of the vote in Texas, respectively. Trump is polling 10 to 12 points below that.\\n\\nThat isn’t just a Texas phenomenon: Other reliably Republican states like Utah, Arizona, and Georgia have also become competitive, and swing states like Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Colorado now appear out of reach for Trump.\\n\\nAll of which makes the close race in Texas look like a fluke—the product of a weak Republican candidate running a disastrous campaign.\\n\\nMany Democrats may already know this, but for anyone tempted to misread this election as a sign that something is fundamentally shifting in Texas politics, let’s run through a few more reasons why this close race is likely fool’s gold.\\n\\nFor one, it was possible to predict that Trump’s nomination could make Texas competitive in the presidential election; in fact, our own Erica Grieder called it months ago.\\n\\nIt’s also telling that the state became a toss up only after Trump’s campaign began to meltdown from scandals probably too numerous to list here. You’ve no doubt read a story or two about them.\\n\\nThat seems to indicate that the free-falling Trump campaign has made Texas a close race rather than any particular action taken by Democrats (Clinton’s recent small television ad buy not withstanding).\\n\\nWhile it’s true that the national GOP looks like a smoking ruin right now, the state party remains fairly strong. It still has huge advantages over Texas Democrats in money, organization, and candidate depth, and Republicans start every statewide race with at least a ten-point edge, if not more. And if you’re thinking that built-in advantage may be shrinking, keep in mind that we’re just two years removed from an across-the-board Republican blowout of nearly 20 points. In Wendy Davis, the Democrats had their best known and best funded candidate in years, and she lost to Greg Abbott by nearly a million votes.\\n\\nIt’s also worth remembering that most statewide offices in Texas come up for election in non-presidential years in which the electorate generally tends to be whiter and older—in other words, more Republican.\\n\\nThe one caveat is the potential increase in Latino voters. R.G. wrote on Monday that more than 530,000 people with Latino surnames have registered to vote since 2012, according to the Texas secretary of state’s office. It’s not hard to envision Trump’s candidacy increasing the number of Latino voters who turn out to vote in Texas, offering Democrats the opportunity to begin building a coalition that could one day make them competitive again.

              " 'Accused mass murderer Alexandre Bissonnette, the only suspect in the Quebec City mosque shooting, is reportedly a legal firearms owner.\\n\\nAccording to Le Journal de Quebec, Bissonnette, 27, who allegedly shot six worshippers to death on January 29, had two guns on him the night of the shooting—a CZ 858 rifle and a 9mm pistol.\\n\\nOwning a pistol requires a restricted license in Canada, which means that police—in Bissonnette\\'s case the Sûreté du Québec—would screen a person for mental health issues, violence, a criminal record, and would check in with at least two character references. But the system relies partially on self-reporting and on the applicant\\'s references to be truthful.\\n\\nRead more: Alleged Quebec Mosque Shooter a Pro-Trump Troll, Says Classmate\\n\\nBissonnette is believed to have received his license two years ago, but Le Journal de Quebec report says he was more recently taking medication for anxiety and had issues with alcohol. The article also said people in Bissonnette\\'s gun club found his behaviour \"bizarre\" but never spoke out about it.\\n\\nThough limited, this information suggests that there are holes in Canada\\'s licensing system.\\n\\nA.J Somerset, the London, Ontario-based author of Arms: the Culture & Credo of the Gun, a book about North American gun culture, told VICE there are a couple of issues with the self-reporting aspect of licensing here. First off—a person can just lie about their mental health status.\\n\\n\"All that\\'s really hanging over your head is if you lie on an application and you get caught, you\\'re probably never going to get a licenses after that.\"\\n\\nAnd while a person\\'s name can be run through Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) to look for any incidents involving police, authorities don\\'t have that option to detect a history of mental illness, Somerset said.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a confidential health record, it\\'s not something police can easily search. It\\'s not something where they can go to very psychiatrist in Quebec City and ask \\'Is this guy being treated for anxiety?\\'\" And allowing cops access to that information would be an infringement of civil liberties.\\n\\nRead more: It Shouldn\\'t Take a Massacre to Humanize Muslims\\n\\nSomerset pointed out that while you would hope a gun owner\\'s references would mention concerns, \"your references are your buddies.\"\\n\\nHe told VICE due to the correlation between drinking and violence, things like a history of drunk driving offences, should be a red flag when someone is applying for a license. He also suggested that a person\\'s interests in extreme ideology should be flagged.\\n\\nBissonnette\\'s acquaintances described being a right-wing troll—one even called him an \"ultra nationalist white supremacist.\" He allegedly admired far right French politician Marine Le Pen.\\n\\nSomerset said these interests should catch the attention of the cops overseeing Canada\\'s licensing regime.\\n\\n\"Someone who reads Infowars and believes right wing conspiracy theories or is a member of the Soldiers of Odin, I wouldn\\'t suggest that you automatically report those people,\" he said. \"But when you see somebody who is just off, I think we need to be more willing to say \\'Maybe this guy shouldn\\'t have a gun\\'.\"\\n\\nTo that end, he said there can be an us-versus-them attitude between gun owners and cops, which is perhaps why fellow gun owners who saw Bissonnette acting \"bizarre\" on the range may have been reluctant to speak out.\\n\\nSomerset is a former Canadian soldier and hunter, who is pro gun control. His book has been highly criticized by the Canadian firearms community.\\n\\nRod Giltaca, President of the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, told VICE no us-versus-them attitude exists. He gun owners want nothing to do with alleged murderers like Bissonnette.\\n\\n\"I would think if someone had a legitimate concern they would have brought it to the attention of the police. We have seen countless examples of mildly concerning or even benign behavior from many infamous murderers in recorded history and we still haven\\'t figured out how to pick them out of the crowd,\" he said.\\n\\nWhen asked about the larger flaws surrounding Canada\\'s licensing laws, however, Giltaca said there are no easy solutions.\\n\\n\"The truth is that there is no regulatory system on guns, knives, hands or cars that can eliminate violent behavior,\" he said, noting that most of Canada\\'s 2.1 million legal gun owners are law abiding citizens.\\n\\n\"Politically it\\'s far easier to create more regulations that mass murderers and criminal will continue to ignore. This tactic fits neatly in a single election cycle and leaves the root cause untouched.\"\\n\\nFollow Manisha Krishnan on Twitter.',\n",

              " 'In an historic shift, the country\\'s largest physician group, the American Medical Association (AMA), has reversed its long-held position that marijuana has no medical value. The group instead adopted a new policy position on medical marijuana, calling for a review of marijuana\\'s status as a Schedule I drug with no accepted medical use under the federal Controlled Substances Act. The AMA had previously recommended that marijuana be retained in Schedule I.\\n\\nThe AMA adopted a report drafted by the AMA Council on Science and Public Health (CSAPH) entitled, \"Use of Cannabis for Medicinal Purposes,\" which affirmed the therapeutic benefits of marijuana and called for further research. \"Short term controlled trials indicate that smoked cannabis reduces neuropathic pain, improves appetite and caloric intake especially in patients with reduced muscle mass, and may relieve spasticity and pain in patients with multiple sclerosis,\" the CSAPH report found.\\n\\n\"Our AMA urges that marijuana\\'s status as a federal Schedule I controlled substance be reviewed with the goal of facilitating the conduct of clinical research and development of cannabinoid-based medicines, and alternate delivery methods,\" the new policy says.\\n\\nBut the AMA goes on to say that it is not endorsing existing state medical marijuana programs.\\n\\nLaying the groundwork for the AMA\\'s shift in position was the adoption in June 2008 by the group\\'s Medical Student Section of a resolution supporting reclassification of marijuana. Leading that effort was University of Washington medical student Sunil Aggarwal, who also played a role as a reviewer of the CSAPH report.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been 72 years since the AMA has officially recognized that marijuana has both already-demonstrated and future-promising medical utility,\" said Aggarwal. \"The AMA has written an extensive, well-documented, evidence-based report that they are seeking to publish in a peer-reviewed journal that will help to educate the medical community about the scientific basis of botanical cannabis-based medicines.\"\\n\\n\"This shift, coming from what has historically been America\\'s most cautious and conservative major medical organization, is historic,\" said Aaron Houston, director of government relations for the Marijuana Policy Project, who attended the AMA meeting. \"Marijuana\\'s Schedule I status is not just scientifically untenable, given the wealth of recent data showing it to be both safe and effective for chronic pain and other conditions, but it\\'s been a major obstacle to needed research.\"\\n\\nThe AMA lagged behind one of its competitors. In February 2008, a the American College of Physicians (ACP), the country\\'s second largest physician group and the largest organization of doctors of internal medicine, adopted a resolution calling for an \"evidence-based review of marijuana\\'s status as a Schedule I controlled substance to determine whether it should be reclassified to a different schedule.\"\\n\\n\"The two largest physician groups in the US have established medical marijuana as a health care issue that must be addressed,\" said ASA Government Affairs Director Caren Woodson. \"Both organizations have underscored the need for change by placing patients above politics.\"\\n\\nAnd so the pressure mounts.',\n",

Residents did not immediately embrace me — a student filmmaker.

While many communities seem to confer on their residents a sense of stability, those at the employee parking lot today generally view their homes as temporary. But if a home is traditionally considered a place where one yearns to return to — a place where the heart is, so to speak — can a temporary dwelling be a home?\\n\\nTheir perspectives are rooted in their community’s complicated history. The lot was created at least a decade ago as an airport-sponsored program offering airline employees a place to rest before heading to their next destination.

As a result of pursuing their dream of working in the aviation industry, with its attendant transient lifestyle, many of the parking lot’s residents are estranged from their families. They are largely a community of people living alone, together — and most now consider the lot “home.” But airport officials do not necessarily share their enthusiasm.

              " 'The 45-storey skyscraper that the Venezuelan entrepreneur David Brillembourg began building in the booming financial centre of Caracas of the early 1990s never did become the emblem of abundance its late owner intended it to be. A banking crisis truncated his dream.\\n\\nBut 20 years later, the incomplete Torre Confinanzas, or Torre de David (Tower of David) as it most widely known, with its staircases that lead nowhere and ramps that spiral into infinity is experiencing something of a renaissance – not as a home for a prosperous bank, but 2,500 squatters.\\n\\nThe squat, thought to be the tallest anywhere in the world, is an eyesore for President Hugo Chávez and his supporters, a reminder that basic housing for millions is a problem in their oil-rich country: 51% of the population lives in precarious shantytowns with no access to basic services. In the capital city alone, there is a shortage of almost 400,000 houses. With little access to loans, and a permissive attitude from the Chavista government towards land invasions and illegal takeovers, squatting has become one of the few housing options people have.\\n\\nThe takeover of Torre de David began four years ago when 300 people forced their way into the derelict building. \"The night we came in, I was scared, but I was also excited to finally have my own home,\" says Jhonny Jimenez, 31, a member of the founding group and now one of the tower\\'s main co-ordinators. \"We organised people according to their needs: the elderly who can\\'t go up flights of stairs would go in the lower floors and large families would get more space.\"\\n\\nTorre de David still lacks basic services, but the building functions well. Each of the 22 inhabited floors has co-ordinators, like Jimenez, who oversee the general functioning of their assigned area.\\n\\nThe management of the building is divided into three departments: health services, recreation and security. Space is granted free, but people pay a monthly fee of 150 Bolívar fuerte (£13) for improvements such as a recreation room for children and an evangelical church being built on the ground floor.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a city within a city, with corner shops on every other floor, cybercafes and apartments that double as hair salons and other types of informal businesses,\" says Leo Alvarez, a lawyer who has documented these informal settlements. \"It functions, and quite well, with no authority other than their pastor.\"\\n\\nAlexander Daza, or el Niño, is the evangelical pastor and the leader of the community, a label he resists. \"I\\'ve done all sorts of work here from carrying sacks of cement to changing lightbulbs. I gained people\\'s respect through example, like Jesus, like Che [Guevara].\" he says. \"We have legalised everything. Nobody has tried to evict us. On the contrary, [government officials] are in favour of us.\"\\n\\nThe future of Torre de David remains a contentious issue. Critics think it would be more profitable to restore the building to its intended use. \"With the money from office spaces like that you could pay for houses that did have proper services for all the people that live there and more,\" says José Alejandro Santana, a professor of architecture at Venezuela\\'s Central University.\\n\\nMike Davis, urban theorist and author of Planet of Slums, thinks Torre de David \"is testimony to the acute housing shortage in Caracas, a problem, like crime, that has vexed the Chávez government. Despite official rhetoric, the Bolivarianist regime has undertaken no serious redistribution of wealth in the cities and oil revenues pay for too many other programmes and subsidies to leave room for new housing construction.\"\\n\\nHe says the building has great potential: \"What interests me more about Torre de David is its emergent ecology with small businesses, jerry-rigged services; it makes it an obvious candidate for a \\'green skyscraper\\' experiment.\"\\n\\nTorre de David is far from the perfect home. No sewage system is in place, lorry-delivered water is rationed, whole sections of the building are in the dark and the absence of lifts forces people to walk up hundreds of stairs.\\n\\nIn some units, the only thing separating its owners from a 30-metre (98ft) fall is caution. And yet, to most of the inhabitants, conditions are better than what they previously had.\\n\\n\"The shanties don\\'t have services either and they\\'re far from everything,\" says Gregorio Laya, a 36 cook who recently moved in. \"Here I step out the door and there is a bus stop that takes me to my job in five minutes. This place is a blessing.\"',\n",
              " 'Second, DST had been founded in 2005, just three years before the 2008 world financial crisis laid waste to many Russian fortunes. Yet by 2009, Milner and Finger were going on a shopping spree that included some $500 million to buy 5 percent of Facebook as well as a chunk of the American online gaming company Zynga. Where did they get all of that money? Milner and Finger had started DST with their own funds, and the returns on their early investments, though very successful, were just a fraction of those sums, pocket change compared with the money they were throwing around by 2010. (At the time, a banker close to DST, who wished to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak on the record, told me that the returns on DST’s other investments “haven’t been sufficient to cover the Facebook and Zynga deals.”)\\n\\nThe funds, it turned out, came largely from Alisher Usmanov, an Uzbek-born billionaire who made his fortune in the mines of Central Asia. Usmanov, who owns a stake in the English football club Arsenal, was then-president Dmitri Medvedev’s patron; Usmanov had advised Medvedev when he served as head of Gazprom, and had been one of the first oligarchs to support Medvedev’s succession. A recent exposé by the opposition leader, Alexey Navalny, said that Usmanov bought luxury villas for Medvedev. (Usmanov sued Navalny for defamation in a Moscow court, and won.) Usmanov also had a fearsome reputation. He was known alternatively as “the hard man of Russia” and a “devourer of websites.” His biography includes a jail sentence from the 1980s for fraud and embezzlement, though a Soviet court later overturned the conviction, as well as a lawsuit in the United States, later dismissed, in which DeBeers claimed that Usmanov was part of a scheme that cheated it of $800 million in profits.\\n\\nMore importantly for the Kremlin, however, Usmanov had a long track record of buying properties—including paintings, publishing houses, and gas fields—on behalf of Kremlin interests. This time, Usmanov bought a 35-percent stake in DST, and was, by all accounts, Milner’s cash cow. “Usmanov’s stake is completely passive,” the banker told me in 2010. “He provides all the cash.”\\n\\nDST made some legitimately lucrative investments for Usmanov. He reportedly made $1 billion on the $200 million he invested in Facebook. The Russian companies that DST invested his money in also did quite well, but that was only half the point. The other half was to give the Kremlin a way to control these new and very influential companies, to make sure there was a receptive person there when the Kremlin called with a demand.\\n\\n“What is DST? DST is the main government internet company,” said one Russian tech executive, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of government reprisals, when I put this question to him in 2010. He was not the only one. In the tech community, another Russian executive told me at the time, “Usmanov”—and, by extension, DST—“is interpreted as a person who, on the Kremlin’s instructions, buys up various Russian [internet] properties.” Interviews with other prominent players in the booming Russian tech sector—local executives as well as Western investors—revealed that this was the near-unanimous understanding of DST’s role in the Russian tech marketplace; people’s equally unanimous reluctance to go on the record showed the sincerity of their belief. According to these insiders, DST’s links to the Kremlin, though close, were less than transparent. “It’s just not clear who, exactly, they represent and so not everybody wants to have them as an investor,” said one American investor I interviewed in 2010.',\n",

But the two are making headlines together following yesterday\\'s report that a woman in Rome became pregnant with twins after undergoing fertility treatment—except the embryos she was implanted with weren\\'t those of her and her partner. The woman wasn\\'t alerted to the issue until she was three months along. The AFP reports the switch somehow happened on Dec. 4 at the Sandro Pertini Hospital in Rome. Four couples received treatment that day, and it\\'s unclear whether any other improper pregnancies resulted.\\n\\nThere\\'s also no word on how the mix-up came to light, though Rome\\'s health authority said it learned there was \"genetic incompatibility\" between the parents and embryos on March 27. The country\\'s health ministry is now investigating, and no further implantations are being done at the clinic. It\\'s far from the first time this has happened: In 2009 an Ohio woman implanted with the wrong embryos gave birth to a baby boy then handed him over to his biological parents; a 2000 in-vitro mix-up saw a San Francisco woman implanted with another couple\\'s embryos as well. The Chronicle reports that the doctor immediately realized his mistake but didn\\'t reveal it; Susan Buchweitz learned of this mistake 10 months after birth after a whistleblower tipped off the Medical Board of California.

Cortana is designed to learn more about a user through use, but that information won’t necessarily be stored in the Notebook without a user’s okay to do so. Finally, Cortana is said to be replacing Bing as the overarching search feature for the Windows Phone mobile OS.\\n\\nIt’s interesting that digital personal assistants are essentially becoming table stakes as a built-in feature of mobile platforms. Microsoft’s entrant might gain some advantages from the work the company has done on Kinect wizardry for the Xbox One, but that device still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of natural language processing, so it’ll be interesting to see how much, if at all, it improves upon the tech used in the console peripheral.',\n",
              " \"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Pinterest Print Mail Flipboard\\n\\nBill O’Reilly had Glenn Beck on his FNC program tonight for what could best be described as a tag team effort to discredit the Color of Change boycott of advertisers on Beck’s show. O’Reilly claimed that the boycott was being carried out by “left wing loons.” Beck blamed Van Jones, and the commies in the Obama administration.\\n\\nHere is the video courtesy of Media Matters:\\n\\nO’Reilly said, “You may remember that earlier this year a fanatical left pressure group called Think Progress tried to get sponsors to boycott The O’Reilly Factor. That effort failed dismally, now Glenn Beck is under fire from another crazy group founded by a guy who is working inside the Obama administration.”\\n\\nBill-O continued the spin job by later saying, “You’ve got far left loons are over the place in this country, and they want to hurt you and they want to hurt me, because they don’t really believe in freedom of speech, the far left loons. They want to hear what they want and if you oppose them, they hate you.”\\n\\nBeck went on the attack against Van Jones. Beck admitted that he didn’t know if Jones was targeting him but said, “I have been telling the truth about this guy for some time. This guy is our new green jobs czar, and he is a self proclaimed communist revolutionary, named his four year old son after a Marxist guerilla out of Africa…believes that Mao Zedong was a great guy. He is now in the White House as a special advisor.”\\n\\nInstead of being a radical group as Beck and O’Reilly charge, here is what Color of Change does according to their website, “ColorOfChange.org is comprised of Black folks from every economic class, as well as those of every color who seek to help our voices be heard. Our members are united behind a simple, powerful pledge: we will do all we can to make sure all Americans are represented, served, and protected—regardless of race or class.”\\n\\nSo Beck and O’Reilly considers a group that is out to politically organize minorities to be radical. Something tells me that if Color of Change was a bunch of white people backing Republicans, Beck and O’Reilly would be praising them. If I understand this correctly, Beck is having his free speech violated, even though he still has his show and is free to say whatever he wants because some advertisers left him.\\n\\nNotice how Glenn and Bill conveniently ignore the fact that the boycott started when Beck called Obama a racist on Fox and Friends. Advisers aren’t leaving Beck because of communists in the White House. They are leaving Beck because race based politics scares the hell out of corporate America. Beck brought this all on himself.\\n\\nThis segment tonight was the beginning of the Fox News push back against the boycott. They are going to try to frame it as a bunch of radical lefties out to get Beck. Unlike the Think Progress boycott of O’Reilly which did have very little success, the Color of Change boycott has worked. FNC can try to spin this any way they want, but it has been a constant headache for Beck and the network.\\n\\nIf you’re ready to read more from the unbossed and unbought Politicus team, sign up for our newsletter here!

Burney were testifying before the Commons foreign affairs committee, days before the House of Commons votes on extending the military mission to 2011.\\n\\nThe key recommendations of Manley’s panel have been adopted by the Stephen Harper government. The prime minister has told NATO and its partners in the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, that Canadian troops would withdraw its troops from Afghanistan next February if the alliance cannot find an additional 1,000 combat troops in the south. Canada has also committed itself to finding transport helicopters to minimize the risks to soldiers from roadside bombs.\\n\\n“We’re trying to highlight for the other countries in ISAF, which is more than NATO, that this is not going well. And it requires a greater commitment,” Mr. Manley told the all-party committee of MPs.\\n\\nMr. Manley said the Taliban was able to take its time and regroup after being driven from power in late 2001.\\n\\n“They waited until the attention of the international community, particularly the West, was distracted by what I’d call the folly in Iraq,” Mr. Manley said. “Before we knew it, we had an all out insurgency on our hands partly because of neglect.”\\n\\nMr. Burney echoed MR. Manley’s assessment of the impact of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. “There’s no question that the commitment in Afghanistan has been distracted by events in Iraq, by the No. 1 player in the military mission and the civilian mission.”\\n\\nBut Mr. Burney added that it is encouraging that, “in the eyes of the aspirants for the presidency in the United States today, from either party, this is the good war.”\\n\\n“It seems to me that some of the distraction of NATO and the reluctance of NATO is a bit of a reflection of the distraction in Washington about the priority Afghanistan has had.

He didn’t elaborate on what that information would be.\\n\\n“There are investigations that are going on. In the next few days there will be revelations about the motivation and the content of this article,” Moore said. “I do not expect the Washington Post to stop, I think they have a political agenda, and I think they’re running that agenda and everybody in this room, everybody watching on these cameras, should ask themselves it’s strange that after 40 years of constant investigations people have waited from four weeks prior to the election to bring their complaints.”\\n\\n',\n",

Final year medical student Lalit Kumar Golaria, 28, was found dead under a bridge in Morena district on January 16 this year.He was a key link in the inter-state gang involved in pumping proxies for medical entrance examinations across India. Whistle-blowers Anand Rai and Ashish Chaturvedi have demanded separate probes into the deaths.While police shut investigations into his death, calling it suicide due to depression, family members said Lalit lived in fear. “We don’t know if he jumped off the bridge or was pushed by someone. He was worried about something, which he never discussed with us,” a family member told TOI. Lalit’s parents received an call for money from him, just two hours before police called them to inform about his death.Lalit was booked in MPPEB scam by special investigation team (SIT) of Gwalior police on January 13, 2014. He was was then in his final year MBBS course at Gajra Raja Medical College (GRMC), Gwalior.In 2013, GRMC committee listed him among 19 students who they said used unfair means to clear examinations. All of them were sacked in 2014 and their cases forwarded to Gwalior SIT for further probe. Lalit was arrested and then released on bail on January 4, this year, said sources.On January 15, Morena police called his family to inform that he had committed suicide and has left behind a note, requesting donation of his body to the medical college for anatomy study.“He came to the bridge on Saakh river in Morena on a bike, left a suicide note and jumped into the river,” sub-inspector of Noorabad police station K Khan told TOI. He also wrote in his suicide note that none should be blamed for his death. Lalit was survived by his wife and five-year-old son.Khan, however, could not come clear if he came across eyewitnesses to bolster the suicide theory. Lalit, had in his note, apologised to his wife and son for taking the extreme step and asked brothers to take care of them, said police. His father was employed with office of accountant general (AG) and died recently.After initial investigations, police said he was reeling under depression after his name surfaced in the scam. He had called his brother a week before his death and demanded Rs 8000. “He also asked for Rs 3000, a few hours before he committed suicide,” said police. Due to his death, SIT could not proceed investigations against the recruitment syndicate which facilitated him with an impersonator in PMT, 2006.',\n",

              " 'Pathological gamblers have a stronger brain reaction to so-called near-miss events: losing events that come very close to a win. Neuroscientists of the Donders Institute at Radboud University show this in fMRI scans of twenty-two pathological gamblers and just as many healthy controls. The scientific journal Neuropsychopharmacology published their results in an early view article last week.\\n\\nDespite being objective losses, near-misses activate a particular reward-related area in the middle of our brain: the striatum. In the current study, neuroscientist Guillaume Sescousse and his colleagues show that this activity is amplified in pathological gamblers. When compared to healthy controls, pathological gamblers show more activity in the striatum after a near-miss event, than after a complete-miss event (see Figure). This activity is thought to reinforce gambling behaviour, supposedly by fostering an illusion of control on the game.\\n\\nTo obtain these results, Sescousse compared fMRI scans of pathological gamblers and healthy adults while they were playing a slot machine game. ‘We’ve made our gambling game as lifelike as possible by improving the visuals, adding more sounds and adapting the speed of the slot wheel compared to previous versions. In our game, the chance for a near-miss was 33%, compared to 17% for a win and 50% for a complete-miss.’\\n\\nIntensive study\\n\\nGamblers have a strong illusion of control and they believe in luck more than others when they gamble. ‘It was challenging to find the subjects for this experiment’, according to Sescousse. ‘The prevalence of pathological gambling is relatively low in the Netherlands, and our study was rather intensive. People had to come back to the Donders Institute three times, and they could not have any additional disorders, diseases or drug prescriptions.’\\n\\nWhat is happening in the mind of a gambler when confronted with a near-miss event? Sescousse: ‘In normal situations near-miss events signal the fact that you are learning: this time you didn’t get it quite yet, but keep practicing and you will. Near-misses thus reinforce your behaviour, which happens by triggering activity in reward-related brain regions like the striatum. This also happens when gambling. But slot machines are random, in contrast to everyday life, which makes them such a great challenge to our brain. That’s why these near-misses may create an illusion of control.’\\n\\nSurprise\\n\\nAnimal studies have shown that behavioral responses to near‐miss events are modulated by dopamine, but this dopaminergic influence had not yet been tested in humans. Therefore, all subjects performed the experiment twice: one time after receiving a dopamine blocker, and one time after receiving a placebo. Surprisingly, brain responses to near-miss events were not influenced by this manipulation. ‘For me, this is another confirmation of the complexity of the puzzle that we are working on’, Sescousse explains.\\n\\nThe study was published in Neuropsychopharmacology.',\n",

              " 'I usually go for a top 5 list. But I couldn’t find 5 scary movies this year so far. Even though I liked movies like “Cabin in the Woods’ and “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter’, those are just not good enough to scare people. So here are the 3 scariest movies that can keep you awake at night.\\n\\n01. The Woman in Black\\n\\nThe Woman in Black is a ghost movie and I consider it’s a must watch movie released in 2012. It’s a story about a little village terrorized by a dead woman who’s seeking for revenge of her son’s death. This movie has tested my limits. I did my best to keep my mouth shut while watching it and not to think about it when I wake up middle of the night. It was that scary, so far the best scary movie this year. It’ll surely freak you out. I won’t go into details much. I’ll just let you watch and enjoy it. It’s a movie worth watching. I don’t like how it ended though. But combination of dark moving backgrounds and music will test your limits. Great performances by “Harry Potter”\\x9d star Daniel Radcliffe.\\n\\nPlot: A young lawyer travels to a remote village where he discovers the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.\\n\\n02. The Devil Inside\\n\\nThe Devil Inside is another creepy movie released earlier this year. It’s a documentary style movie. I normally hate documentary movies. But there’s something in this movie that kept me interested. I hear lots of negative reviews about it. But movie was not disappointing. Sure it was a low-budget movie. But in my opinion, it’s scary enough to be in second on this list. It’s a story about demons taking control over human bodies. Honestly I believe these stuff. In my society, we have special methods to treat these people, which often involved with sacrificing of chickens in exchange of human body (Basically making a deal with demon). The Devil Inside also doesn’t have the greatest ending. But it’s worth watching. You have to be a believer to enjoy it to its full capacity.\\n\\nPlot: In Italy, a woman becomes involved in a series of unauthorized exorcism during her mission to discover what happened to her mother, who allegedly murdered three people during her own exorcism.\\n\\n03. Chernobyl Diaries\\n\\nChernobyl Diaries is another movie worth watching. I can’t say it’ll scare you to hell. But it has its moments to scare you. It has a good storyline. It’s about 3 tourist couples going for an adventure on an abandoned city near Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. They have been told that everyone lived there were left 25 years ago. But they soon find out that they are stuck in the city and not everyone has left 25 years ago. Stage is set for a great horror by halfway of the movie, but it never happened in the end. It leaves unanswered questions and ending didn’t amuse me. Plus, you never get a good look at things that are killing these people. Movie is good enough to be in this list. But it could have been a better movie.\\n\\nPlot: Six tourists hire an extreme tour guide who takes them to the abandoned city Pripyat, the former home to the workers of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. During their exploration, they soon discover they are not alone.\\n\\nThese are my favorites so far this year. Although none of it ended the way I liked. It’s becoming the nature of this genre. None of these movies has disgusting scenes or sex on it. So if you’re looking for those this is not the list for you. You may consider “Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning”\\x9d. So enjoy and be scared. Watch out for dogs if you’re watching The Devil Inside.',\n",

              " '\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\\n\\nRepublicans in the Senate voted Wednesday night on a bill that would significantly accelerate the repeal of key elements of the Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare) through reconciliation. As Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) has acknowledged, this will almost certainly mean that Republicans will effectively get rid of the health-care law before coming up with a replacement. On the face of it, this seems like terrible politics. If Obamacare looks like it is unraveling, insurance companies are likely to pull out quickly, potentially leaving millions of people without health insurance and leaving Republicans with the blame. It’s a very risky gamble, but one that may have a strategic logic behind it.\\n\\nThe Republicans are burning their bridges\\n\\nGOP Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) has defended the Republican strategy as an exercise in bridge building. He told the New York Times: “The Obamacare bridge is collapsing, and we’re sending in a rescue team. . . . Then we’ll build new bridges to better health care, and finally, when these new bridges are finished, we’ll close the old bridge.” Actually, they’re burning the bridges behind them so that they have no choice but to fight. The recently deceased game theorist Thomas Schelling describes the strategy of bridge burning as follows, in his classic book “Arms and Influence”:\\n\\nOften, we must maneuver into a position where we no longer have much choice left. This is the old business of burning bridges. If you are faced with an enemy who thinks you would turn and run if he kept advancing, and if the bridge is there to run across, he may keep advancing. . . . But if you burn the bridge so that you cannot retreat, and in sheer desperation there is nothing you can do but defend yourself, he has a new calculation to make.\\n\\nAvinash Dixit and Barry Nalebuff expand on this basic idea to note that bridge-burning may have two benefits. First, it unites your own forces. They have to fight because they know that there is no alternative — desertion or retreat is no longer a possibility. Second, it may cause the enemy to retreat, because they know that they face a truly determined opponent, who has no choice but to fight.\\n\\nAfter nearly seven hours of voting and over the vocal objections of many Democrats, the Senate voted 51 to 48 to pass a budget resolution to begin work on legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\\n\\nRepublican leaders are deliberately backing their party into a corner\\n\\nThis plausibly explains why key Republicans want to repeal Obamacare before replacing it. They are burning the bridges behind themselves. Republicans don’t have any agreed plan to replace Obamacare (Paul Krugman has argued that this is no accident, because any possible replacement would be horribly unpopular). Thus, they face the risk of their anti-Obamacare coalition falling apart, as Republicans start to fight among themselves, and Democrats pick off the weaker members of the pack.\\n\\nRepealing before replacing might possibly forestall the rout. First, it might stiffen Republicans’ backs. If they cannot retreat to a tacit acceptance of Obamacare — since Obamacare is gone, they may be more likely to stick together and agree on a replacement. Even if that replacement is going to be very unpopular, it probably would be less unpopular than getting rid of Obamacare and replacing it with nothing.\\n\\nSecond, it might help peel off Democrats. The Democrats’ leader in the Senate, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), has sworn that Democrats will not compromise with Republicans on any Obamacare replacement. Republican leaders are probably thinking that the Democrats’ calculus will change if they are faced with a choice between a feeble replacement and no replacement.\\n\\nThis is incredibly risky\\n\\nAs Schelling, Dixit and Nalebuff suggest, burning bridges might help the Republicans get out of the trap that they have created themselves. It may both stiffen Republicans’ resolve and make their adversaries more likely to retreat.\\n\\nYet as these scholars probably would point out, this is still an extremely risky strategy. Burning your bridges so that you have no hope of retreat means that you risk losing all your forces if you are defeated. It also may be highly unpopular with the troops. Republicans in the House seem to be very nervous about the idea of repealing without replacing. Senate Republicans like Collins also look to be unhappy. Finally, President-elect Donald Trump has promised that his administration will somehow come up with an Obamacare replacement in short order — although it is unclear what that may be.',\n",

Dobrovolny said stations will be located at cycling-friendly spots near established bike routes such as Hornby Street, the seawall and False Creek as well as near SkyTrain stations and bus stops.\\n\\nThe bike share program will operate much like a car share, with annual memberships and ride costs tabulated based on time.

              " \"Zipper, the functional cursor into a data structure, is itself a data structure, derived from the original one. The derived data type D' for the recursive data type D is D with exactly one hole. Filling-in the hole -- integrating over all positions of the hole -- gives the data type D back. Zipper is the derivative, pretty much in the calculus sense, of a data type. The zipper-as-datatype view was the original presentation, described by Huet (JFP, 1997) and Hinze and Jeuring (JFP 2001); the data structure derivative was expounded by McBride.\\n\\nWe advocate a different view, emphasizing not the result of navigating through a data structure to a desired item and extracting it, but the process of navigation. Each data structure comes with a method to enumerate its components, representing the data structure as a stream of the nodes visited during the enumeration. To let the user focus on a item and submit an update, the enumeration process should yield control to the user once it reached an item. Co-routines provide exactly the right yielding mechanism. As Chung-chieh Shan aptly put it, ``zipper is a suspended walk.''\\n\\nWhereas datatype-derivative zipper necessarily depends on the data type (different data types have different derivatives), the suspended-walk zipper is datatype-invariant. We only need a traversal procedure that applies a given function to each item of the data structure. The zipper is obtained by supplying the mapping function that yield s. Since the traversal procedure can generically handle many data types (think of map ), so can the zipper. Our zipper type depends only on the interface of the traversal function.\\n\\nThe two views of zipper are dual: they both regard zipper as the context of a data structure traversal.

There was Cowboy George disappearing into the sunset, draggling a few twigs of Crawford brush behind him, while Old Man McCain, patriarch of Sedona Ranch -- or one of those dang houses, never could remember which -- was waving him off with relief. And suddenly there she was -- out of the Alaskan blue -- Cowgirl Sarah, twirling her guns and cocking her jaw like Clint Eastwood in full attack mode, a loner out for justice.\\n\\nDespite all the chants for change in both camps, those Repubs know that nothing speaks louder than that old reliable cowboy image honed by generations of Hollywood directors like Ford, beloved by generations of city-bred Winchester and Marlboro men like Cheney, and adopted by every president since cowboy actor Ronald Reagan put on boots and spurs.\\n\\nBut Cowboy George nearly wrecked the genre. It was just bad casting. Despite the learned strut and the put-on twang, he never could get the hang of looking real. He was always Preppie Cowboy.

While Buffalo Bill Cody could make a star in 1885 of little Annie Oakley (real name Phoebe Ann Moses), it was because she was a sharpshooter, not a rider or roper. As rodeos burgeoned in the next century, a number of showbiz gals like Prairie Rose Henderson got fame as \"cowgirls\" when they wore fancy costumes while riding a bucking horse. But they were kicked out in 1936, when rodeo cowboys under Gene Autry organized their first professional guild. From then on, girls were relegated to the roles of rodeo queens or half-time showgirls or, most ignominious of all, barrel racers.',\n",

Most were in place just before the Mosul offensive began, but some are still trickling in.\\n\\n“Whenever you liberate a city the size of Mosul, you can expect to get a tremendous amount of information,” said Col. John L. Dorrian, the chief American military spokesman in Baghdad. “Certainly, if we have a window of opportunity that presents itself rather quickly, we do have adequate forces in theater to go ahead and act upon that.”\\n\\nThe intelligence surge would most likely “give us a lot of insight into Daesh networks not just in Iraq and Syria, but it also gives insight into how they export terror around the world, some of the people they work with, how they finance themselves,” Colonel Dorrian said.\\n\\nThat is important because even as the Islamic State loses its physical caliphate, or religious state, in Iraq and Syria, the group can still inflict deadly assaults, senior American counterterrorism officials say. “It’s our judgment that ISIL’s capacity and ability today to carry out attacks in Syria and Iraq and abroad has not thus far been significantly diminished,” Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told Congress last month. “The tempo of ISIL-linked terrorist attacks and terrorist activity in Europe and other places around the globe is a reminder of that global reach.”\\n\\n“This external operations capability has been building and entrenching over the past two years,” he warned, “and we don’t think that battlefield or territorial losses alone will be sufficient to completely degrade the group’s terrorism capabilities.”',\n",

              " 'Donald Trump continued to push the contentious issue of Ted Cruz’s presidential eligibility on Friday, threatening that he has legal standing to sue Cruz for not being a “natural born citizen.”\\n\\n“If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen,” Trump posted on Twitter.\\n\\nDoes Trump really have grounds to sue Cruz? According to some legal experts, the answer is yes, but they’re divided on how a court would handle such a claim. The real estate mogul has previously raised questions about whether Cruz’s Canadian birth disqualifies him from being considered a natural born citizen, warning that Democrats might file a lawsuit to dispute Cruz’s presidential eligibility. Some voters have already filed suits against Cruz, but experts tend to agree that a suit filed by a rival candidate, such as Trump, would hold more weight.\\n\\n“For standing, you have to have injury, and his injury would be that he could quite possibly lose votes that would go to Cruz that might’ve gone to him,” said Mary Brigid McManamon, a constitutional law professor at Delaware Law School. She said a voter’s claim is less significant because their injury is the same as that of everyone in the state.\\n\\nHarvard law professor Laurence Tribe said Trump’s standing is plausible but not legally guaranteed.\\n\\n“Its plausibility gets greater the closer we get to the point where it’s clear that Cruz himself (and not Cruz together with Bush, Kasich, Rubio, and perhaps others) is the real obstacle to Trump’s nomination and thus a clear source of concrete injury to Trump’s prospects for the Republican presidential nomination,” Tribe said in an email.\\n\\nBoth McManamon and Tribe have argued that Cruz is not a natural born citizen based on a strict interpretation of the Constitution and is, therefore, not eligible to be president. McManamon said Trump should win a suit if he chooses to bring one, but she’s cautious about predicting what a court would do.\\n\\n“It would be interesting to see if a court would actually take it,” she said. “They really don’t want to be in the middle of a political hot potato.”\\n\\nJonathan Adler, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University, is skeptical that a court would touch the issue at all. He said Trump would likely file a suit in one state to try to get Cruz excluded from that state’s ballot.\\n\\n“Whether or not he would have standing would ultimately depend on that state’s rules,” Adler said. “There are some courts who might say this is really a question for voters to determine.”\\n\\nAdler, who has argued that Cruz is a natural born citizen, said he doesn’t see any basis for a claim brought in federal court, but he thinks Trump could argue injury at the state level.\\n\\n“Trump has at least a more plausible claim of injury because he can claim that he lost votes because of one erroneous decision on ballot eligibility,” Adler said, adding that he doesn’t expect a suit would get very far.\\n\\n“I happen to think that the best arguments on the merits support Cruz’s eligibility, but even apart from that, I just don’t see courts intervening on this sort of thing,” Adler said, noting that Trump would be fighting an uphill battle. “I mean, he’s done crazier things, so we’ll see.”\\n\\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.',\n",

A feeling of ultra nationalism is sweeping the world and protectionist tendencies are on the rise. From the crisis in Greece to Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump in the US, the world is increasingly seeing a subtle but sure shift towards nationalist feelings impacting immigration, but more importantly trade.\\n\\nRestrictive trade practices which were frowned upon not too far back are slowly getting accepted. Companies and businesses are showing a reluctant tendency to accept the same. But is this trend, which was not seen much after the Second World War, the way forward? Ron Paul differs.\\n\\nWho is Ron Paul?\\n\\nRon Paul is a prominent voice in the US political-economic circles who is known for his views on low taxes, free markets and constitutional government. He is a former member of the House of Representatives and has been a presidential candidate thrice. Ron has always spoken out for prosperity, liberty and peace. He advocates a drastic reduction in the size of the federal government accompanied by a return to basic constitutional principles.\\n\\n‘Protectionists’ vs. Ron Paul\\n\\nMonopolies and Restrictive trade practices are a big hindrance to the free market economy. There was a time when the developing and third world countries were not part of the WTO and had narrow and un-coordinated trade policies which were tailor made to protect their own markets and jobs. The developed world was looking for markets to off load their finished products. The cost of finished product increased beyond profitable levels and the availability of cheaper workforce pushed manufacturing to the developing world.\\n\\nThe champions of free market economy were suddenly not so sure and electorates reposed their faith in right wing politicians who advocated protectionist trade policies. Ron Paul is not amongst them.\\n\\nRon Paul’s Outlook\\n\\nRon has always advocated return to sound monetary policies. He has always opposed anything that goes against the basic grain of freedom of citizens, be it economic, political or social. He has always voted against any move to raise taxes, unbalanced budget, raising congressional pay, regulating the Internet and government-paid junket. He was also against the Iraq war, against the Patriot Act and the proposal to increase the power of the executive branch.\\n\\nThe Way Forward\\n\\nRon in his New Year message to the incoming Donald Trump administration had outlined his four key proposals as the way forward. He continued with his known position of closing down the US Federal Reserve after an audit. He also champions a cut in both taxes and spending including on health and military spending. Getting the US troops deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq finds a place in his list. His commitment to free market policies makes him advocate the scrapping of Obamacare and have a true free-market healthcare system.\\n\\nA true patriot and believer of the American Culture, Ron Paul at the age of 81 still stands firm for free equal and just policies.\\n\\nThe future of the media is in our hands!

              " 'Just two years after it was treading water as a fading startup called dotCloud, open-source darling Docker is soaring. The company announced Tues. it had raised a $95 million Series D funding that should value the company at about $1 billion, making it the latest in a wave of private tech companies to join the billion-dollar ranks.\\n\\nThe funding comes just half a year after Docker had raised its last funding and was led by a previously minor investor in the startup, Insight Venture Partners, alongside new investors Coatue, Goldman Sachs and Northern Trust . A who\\'s-who of venture firms already backing Docker re-upped in the round: Benchmark, Greylock Partners, Sequoia Capital, Trinity Ventures and Jerry Yang\\'s AME Cloud Ventures. While Docker didn\\'t disclose its valuation from the round, sources with knowledge peg the company\\'s pre-money valuation at just under $1 billion. PitchBook pegs the post-money valuation at $1.07 billion.\\n\\nJust 22 people in Jan. 2014, Docker now has more than 120, scrambling to meet the demand of the developer community for its flagship containers, virtual wrappers that package an application\\'s code and make it easy to break up an app into pieces that can be quickly upgraded, approved and swapped out. The open-source version of the Docker product has been downloaded more than 300 million times, representing more than 1,000% growth; more than 33,000 GitHub projects have Docker in the title alone.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve seen unprecedented growth and momentum in all aspects of our business,\" says CEO Ben Golub . \"We want to have all the resources we need to take advantage of it, especially with all the mainstream enterprises jumping into Docker.\"\\n\\nDespite its short lifespan, Docker does have powerful friends in the enterprise. The company has made high profile partnerships with the big players like Amazon Web Services, IBM , Microsoft and VMware. The company has the highest buying intention score of any enterprise company or open-source project in six years of tracking by research firm Enterprise Technology Research. And existing customers include Gilt, Goldman Sachs, Spotify and Yelp.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs and Northern Trust, two of the investors joining this funding round, are actually users of Docker containers whose interest started in their IT departments, Golub says. By having Insight lead the round and Coatue join in, Docker\\'s also signalling it\\'s moving into the growth stage of companies typically much older than two years.\\n\\nThe reason for the quick successive funding is that while Docker sees massive opportunity ahead of it, the company\\'s in a critical phase of adolescence. It\\'s only been offering a hosted site for work organizations to share projects, Docker Hub, since last June, and it announced the beta of its big-company paid offering, Docker Hub Enterprise, in Dec., with 15 large companies testing so far.\\n\\nThe vast majority of Docker users don\\'t, and won\\'t pay for their usage. They fall under the purview of founder and former CEO Solomon Hykes, who as CTO oversees the open-source, free Docker Project. So when it comes to making real money from big customers, Docker\\'s still new to the game. That means investors are offering money as fast as the company will take it to build out a sales team and keep its product on schedule. The company raised its Series C before it had spent the money from its Series A, and is only halfway through the money from its Series B while it raised the current round.\\n\\n\"People are racing to get behind the opportunity here because they see a wide open market that\\'s rethinking the entire data center,\" says investor Jerry Chen of Greylock. \"This will be a multi-billion dollar company and they need this money to reach their full potential. Investors are saying, \\'Hey there\\'s a huge opportunity in front of you, don\\'t be afraid to be aggressive.\\'\"\\n\\nDocker\\'s in a race with a whole wave of sometime-partner startups in the cloud space, many of them also open-sourced. Golub says the company\\'s committed to supporting and building that ecosystem out, with apps helping people work \"into the thousands.\"\\n\\n\"Right now the watchword is to give flexibility,\" Golub says. But Docker still aspires to be the biggest of the bunch. Vmware, the virtual machine company, trades at a market cap north of $35 billion today. \"We have the potential to build one of the most significant companies of the decade,\" Golub adds. \"But we have a lot of hard work to do to get there, for a two-year-old company with 120 people and a pet turtle.\"',\n",

He would be as regular a starter as Boateng.\\n\\nIn fact, with Hummels, Bayern would have the best back four in the world; pair that with Neuer as your keeper, and defensive records will be broken.\\n\\nEthical Concerns:\\n\\nOk so yeah this is where it gets tricky. I am a Bayern fan and thus would love to have Hummels join us, but at the same time I recognize the frustration of the other teams in the league.\\n\\nTaking competitor’s players:\\n\\nWith Hummels it would be three top players in four years years that Bayern have snatched up one from Dortmund (Götze, and Lewandowski).\\n\\nHowever Bayern are not the only guilty ones, here are some other noteworthy Bundesliga transfers:\\n\\nBVB:\\n\\nCastro from Leverkusen\\n\\nReus from Gladbach\\n\\nWolfsburg:\\n\\nKruse from Gladbach\\n\\nDraxler from Schalke\\n\\nLeverkusen:\\n\\nPapadopoulos from Schalke\\n\\nKampl from Dortmund\\n\\nSchalke:\\n\\nSam from Leverkusen\\n\\nBarnetta from Leverkusen\\n\\nSantana from Dortmund\\n\\nAs one can see there are a lot of inter-team transfers in the Bundesliga. This issue, while still important, is too common to put all the blame on Bayern.\\n\\nParity of the league\\n\\nTaking your direct competitors best players is of course troubling for the parity of the league.\\n\\nThe gold standard of competitive leagues Premier League. Look at the season Leicester is having, and to a lesser extent West Ham. Here are some facts:\\n\\nIn the Bundesliga, Bayern have a 27 point lead over THIRD place (Bayer Leverkusen).\\n\\nIn the EPL that is the difference between first and ninth (Leicester and Chelsea…. lol).\\n\\nHowever, I am not sure what the Bundesliga are to do about this. One thing is for sure, cutting Bayern’s spending is not the solution. Bayern aren’t even in the top-10 of big spenders of world football.\\n\\nLet’s look at some data from transfermarkt.\\n\\nBiggest spenders in transfer market over the past 5 years:\\n\\nManchester City: 752.95 million Euros Chelsea: 691.20 million Euros Manchester United: 587.56 million Euros\\n\\nNow we will skip a few:\\n\\n10. AS Roma: 382.51 million Euros\\n\\nAnd finally:\\n\\n13. FC Bayern Munich: 342.90 million Euros\\n\\nLast summer Bayern were outspent by every club still in Champion’s League (City spent over 200 million euros), and numerous others like Monaco, AC Milan, and PSG.\\n\\nThere has to be some understanding that if it wasn’t Bayern luring Hummels away it would certainly be another club with a ridiculous transfer fee and high wages.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nFans should be thrilled, yet wary of the arrival of Hummels. His skill will no doubt lead Bayern on to greater success. However his purchase and the general power of big clubs in both drawing in players, and vastly outspending smaller clubs is something that should set off alarms in every football fan’s head.\\n\\nAgree/Disagree?

              " 'Chinese personal shoppers have created a new type of retail store in Australia\\n\\nUpdated\\n\\nIt might seem unlikely that there are stores selling only a small range of products at prices significantly higher than supermarkets yet turning over millions of dollars each year.\\n\\nBut an increase in stores catering to personal shoppers, called daigou, are growing in the Australian retail scene.\\n\\nAs demand for Australian products increases, daigou stores allow Chinese shoppers to send goods to China. One public relation agency estimated there are between 1,200 to 1,600 small daigou stores that offer \"pack and send\" services in Australia. Until now, these businesses were fragmented and operated independently.\\n\\nHowever, the first Daigou retailer recently listed on the ASX, AuMake. The retailer has seven stores in Sydney and plans for more.\\n\\nDaigou stores are emerging in response to the demands of a burgeoning Chinese middle class and their hunger for Australian brands. By 2022, 76 per cent of China\\'s urban population will be considered middle class.\\n\\nWhy Australian brands can\\'t \\'go it alone\\'\\n\\nPoor quality Chinese products, food safety concerns combined with ongoing issues of counterfeiting have contributed to a deficit in trust of Chinese brands. This lack of trust is driving demand for authentic, high quality products - particularly from Western markets like Australia.\\n\\nSo, why don\\'t Australian business simply cut out the middleman and go straight to the consumer?\\n\\nIt comes down to the establishment of trust between the consumer and the retailer, and the length of time it takes a foreign retail business to establish consumer trust in China. Australian-based brands like Suisse, Blackmores and Jurlique sell through Daigou retailers to quickly establish authenticity of the product and consumer trust.\\n\\nDaigou businesses are quickly becoming market influencers, that can make or break brands in China. Case in point is Bellamy\\'s infant formula — Airwallex Founder Lucy Liu stated:\\n\\n\"What Bellamy\\'s didn\\'t expect was that the daigous\\' customers would be more loyal to their daigou, than to the Bellamy\\'s brand.\"\\n\\nChinese consultancies are now offering to connect Australian businesses with highly-influential Chinese bloggers and Chinese social media personalities to help promote products and services.\\n\\nA viable market\\n\\nDespite low domestic growth in food and groceries, an AFGC State of the Industry Report identified a real hunger for Australian manufactured brands internationally. In 2015-16 food and beverage exports grew by 11 per cent to $26 billion and grocery (non-food) exports up 32 per cent to $4 billion.\\n\\nNotably, China has become Australia\\'s largest export market for the first time in 2016-17.\\n\\nSo lucrative is this daigou model, that the 2017 Australia-China Business Week Conference allocated an entire afternoon to a workshop on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The aim of the session was to demonstrate to marketers and business how WeChat could be utilised to connect, influence and sell to Chinese consumers.\\n\\nGlobal consultancy firms like Nielsen are scrambling to advise entrepreneurs and brands on how they can leverage this new retail model for financial growth.\\n\\nA final cautionary note\\n\\nAs these daigou stores open up around Australia and become the legitimate \"go to\" for Chinese consumers seeking quality, authentic Australian brands, it would appear the days of individual daigous stripping supermarket shelves of infant formula may be numbered. The model provides a regulated channel to the Chinese consumer and circumnavigates the need for individual daigou shoppers.\\n\\nWhile this new retail model presents a great opportunity for Australian products and brands, ultimately, the future remains uncertain. On one hand, Chinese entrepreneurs may increase the number of stores across Australia and small brands will compete for shelf space, in order to access the lucrative Chinese market. Alternatively, established daigou relationships based on trust may endue and the business model becomes irrelevant.\\n\\nIn the end, this retail model remains viable only as long as the Chinese government permit online shopping from international markets - they could close the door overnight.\\n\\nChinese officials have already imposed bans on foreign books, movies and games being imported to China.\\n\\nTopics: community-and-society, business-economics-and-finance, retail, industry, china, australia\\n\\nFirst posted',\n",
              " 'The president isn’t intimidated in the slightest by the major money from fossil-fuel and the pact the industry has with the conservative right as he announced new investment incentives for renewable energy.\\n\\nBloomberg reported that on Monday, the White House announced a $1 billion increase in loan guarantees for renewable energy projects and $24 million in new grants for solar research and measures to reduce costs for homeowners to install solar panels. In addition, the current administration also noted that it would approve a transmission line for a large solar plant in Riverside County, California.\\n\\n“We’re going to make it even easier for individual homeowners to put solar panels on their roof with no upfront cost,” Obama said Monday night at the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas. “A lot of Americans are going solar and becoming more energy-efficient not because of tree huggers — although trees are important, just want you to know — but because they’re cost-cutters.”\\n\\nObama is really ruffling feathers in his last years in office. After meeting an agony of gridlock on nearly every decision in his first term, Obama is ready to deliver on everything he promised and then some to environmentalists in his early years. Most recently, policies to address what the president called “one of the greatest challenges we face this century,” such as the Clean Power Plan and the revamped solar programs, have infuriated traditional fuel producers. However, Obama stated firmly that the industry will thrive despite opposition by Republicans and fossil-fuel suppliers.\\n\\nObama said opponents of renewable energy feel threatened by the emerging industry and seek to make it more costly by “a massive lobbying effort” in Washington.\\n\\n“That’s not progress, that’s not innovation,” he stated.\\n\\nExpectedly, the GOP has tried to gut federal funding for clean energy programs, accusing the Obama administration of wasting money. United States Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz claimed that the logic is folly, and clean energy would continue to expand without government assistance, just at a slower pace.\\n\\nThat pace isn’t agreeable with 97 percent of publishing scientists who agree that warming trends over the past century are likely due to human activities. Apparently, the way Obama is making strides this year, it’s not ok with him either.',\n",

              " 'We’ve spent the last month investigating many angles within virtual reality—from its implications on the web, to how VR can create peak emotional experiences on demand, to discussing whether it is okay if we prefer VR to our own physical reality.\\n\\nLast week, we brought the dialogue to Singularity University with the Future of Virtual Reality Event. After demos and during a panel discussion at the event, the speakers hit on an area that we have yet to cover in depth—learning and education.\\n\\nDuring the panel, Jazmin Cano, co-founder of VR gaming company Winistry and previously lead tech artist at Discovr Labs, guided the conversation to the subject of education and how we might use VR to create educational environments that are conducive for learners that thrive in more visual and immersive settings.\\n\\nPicture this: You’re a ninth grade student enrolled in a mandatory biology course, and science is not your forte. Every time you sit down in class and watch the daily PowerPoint lecture, you struggle to follow the teacher and walk out realizing you captured pages of notes, but no real understanding of the subject matter.\\n\\nIt’s frustrating.\\n\\nOne day, you find a VR headset sitting at each table, and your teacher explains that today you’ll learn about the inner workings of the human bloodstream. You put on the headset, and the next thing you know, you’re flying through the bloodstream. You see cells passing by, and there’s even a little guy guiding you through the session, explaining each variable you’re interacting with as it passes.\\n\\nIt turns out this scenario is already happening.\\n\\n“There’s actually one child from the children’s hospital who tried it, and he was dyslexic, so reading from pages was hard for him in the first place,” Cano said. “But being able to go into the body and learning that way, he was able to understand how the body works more than from just reading it. And that’s something that we think could really help a lot of people.”\\n\\nOne of the largest challenges facing education is the one-size-fits-all model that most curriculums follow. For the many students who are different types of learners—visual, experiential, spatial, kinesthetic—traditional classroom learning models leave them in the dark. The information simply does not stick.\\n\\nImagine taking tests in VR with a personal guide that adapted to the learning style of each user—reading exam questions to auditory learners, or creating a more peaceful test-taking environment for those who experience testing anxiety.\\n\\nCurrently, different types of learners are disadvantaged in the classroom and pigeonholed as low performers. Many times, however, it has nothing to do with the intelligence of the individual. The possibilities opened by bringing VR to the classroom for these students would literally be gamechanging—grade changing.\\n\\n“If I had learned science with VR, I would have been a straight A student.” – Ryan Pulliam\\n\\nWe’d love to hear from you: Tweet to us @singularityhub or to me @DigitAlison with your ideas and comments.\\n\\nImage Credit: Shutterstock.com',\n",

In order to compensate affected customers, Hyundai provided a lifetime reimbursement program to cover the additional fuel costs associated with the rating change plus a 15 percent premium in acknowledgement of the inconvenience.

With an approval rating of 44 percent, Trump is the only president to have a negative net approval rating this early into his administration.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nTrump’s approval numbers, however, are slightly better than they were a week before his inauguration, when he had a 40 percent approval and 52 percent disapproval. But his numbers have worsened since November, when as the newly minted president-elect he had a 46 percent approval and 45 percent disapproval ratings.\\n\\nPresident Ronald Reagan, a former Hollywood actor and California governor who previously held the record low approval rating at this point, tops the incumbent reality TV star-turned-president by 7 percentage points. Reagan had a 51 percent approval rating in January 1981.\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama, Trump’s immediate predecessor, had the highest approval rating. He sat an overwhelming 76 percent in February 2009.\\n\\nDespite his low approval, nearly 8-in-10 respondents said Trump has handled the opening weeks of his presidency as expected. For 42 percent, that’s a good thing. But 35 percent said it’s a bad thing, and for 17 percent who said the early days of the Trump administration have diverged from what they expected, his departure from their expectations is also a bad thing.\\n\\nTrump has opened his administration with an aggressive agenda that has included a number of executive orders and presidential memoranda. But he has harped on his historic election in nearly all of his public comments, proclaimed a war against the media, disputed reports that his inaugural crowd size was smaller than Obama’s in 2009 and told congressional leaders privately — without evidence — that he lost the popular vote because 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton. He has called for an investigation into his unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.\\n\\nWhile Trump has positive net approval ratings for his handling of the economy and national security, a majority disapprove of how he has handled terrorism (53 percent), health care policy (50 percent), immigration (56 percent) and foreign affairs (55 percent).\\n\\nFifty-three percent of respondents said things in the country are going either pretty or very badly, and a majority of Americans disagree with some of the president’s top actions, including his travel ban and border wall.\\n\\nFifty-three percent oppose last week’s executive order temporarily barring travel to the U.S. from citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries, with 46 percent arguing that it makes the U.S. less safe from terrorism and 49 percent saying it harms Americans values by preventing those seeking asylum from entering the country. And 55 percent, counter to the White House’s characterization, said the travel restriction amounts to a ban on Muslims, which Trump proposed during his presidential campaign. More than 7 in 10 also said they not only believe that Islamic State-associated terrorists are already in the U.S. but that they also have the resources to launch a major attack at any time.\\n\\nTrump campaigned on a massive border wall that he insisted Mexico will pay for (Mexican officials have repeatedly denied that they will), but 60 percent of respondents oppose his signature pledge.\\n\\nThe CNN/ORC poll of 1,002 American adults was conducted Jan. 31-Feb. 2 via landline and cellphone.

Pyramid Lake, which today lies on a Paiute Indian reservation, was part of that ancient lake, and inside its unique inland water system, which includes the Truckee River and Lake Tahoe, a giant strain of trout evolved.\\n\\n“Our fish have deep meaning for us, spiritually,” said Albert John, executive director of fisheries for the tribe. “And if they could get to 40 pounds again, whoa, that’d be awesome.”\\n\\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fishermen netted scores of Lahontan cutthroats to feed miners and loggers gnawing at the Sierra Nevada Mountains. But the Truckee River, where the fish spawned, was dammed, and its level dropped as water was taken for irrigation. It was also polluted with chemicals and sawdust. And Lake Tahoe was stocked with a nonnative char called lake trout, which gobble baby cutthroat. By the mid-1940s, all the native trout in Pyramid Lake and Lake Tahoe were dead and the strain was declared extinct.\\n\\n“They never should have gone in the first place,” said Fred Crosby, 66, owner of Crosby Lodge, the only bar, restaurant, gas station and tackle shop in tiny Sutcliffe, Nev., a poor reservation town on the west shore of Pyramid Lake.',\n",

Using the same tech the military use for seeing through walls, it looks straight through the chest and into the lungs. It’s meant to be worn by the patient for 90 minutes each day and is designed for outpatient use — meaning that it can be used in their home, rather than the hospital. Wexner Medical Center is currently carrying out a randomized, clinical trial to test the SensiVest’s efficacy.\\n\\nSo far, things are looking good.\\n\\n“The vest is based on radar technology,” Dr. Rami Kahwash, a principal researcher involved in the study, told Digital Trends. “It uses sensors that emit electromagnetic waves which let it calculate the fluid content of the wearer’s lungs. That number is then transmitted to a secure website, where it can be accessed by physicians. If the patient is recording these numbers daily, then by the end of the week or month we’ll have a set of numbers that give us a good idea of the amount of fluid in their lungs.”\\n\\nThe SensiVest clinical trial is still underway, but a previous investigation suggested that use of the SensiVest can mean 87 percent fewer hospital readmissions.\\n\\nThat is not just about giving physicians an easier day, though. According to Kahwash, by the time patients present in the hospital, it can be too late to act. Studies have shown that the buildup of fluid in the lungs can actually start two weeks before patients seek help, which opens up a potentially lifesaving use for this technology.\\n\\n“The hope is that if we can track this trend of fluid in the lungs, we can intervene early on as soon as we see that the numbers are going up,” Kahwash said.\\n\\nAt present, patients do not see the numbers that the device gathers. That could change in the future, though. Kahwash hypothesized that, should the numbers be made available to the patient, doctors could also provide them with a manual algorithm — letting them adjust their medication dosage according to the numbers gathered by the SensiVest.\\n\\n“Perhaps that way we may eliminate the physician out of the cycle, which could result in more prompt interventions on a day-by-day basis,” Kahwash said.',\n",

Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama had previously been brought aboard to write a screenplay that reconceived the single-house parlor mystery as a globe-trotting thriller with deductive reasoning at its core, which seems to remain the plan for the Fox version.

The 1985 film version was directed by Jonathan Lynn and starred Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Martin Mull, Lesley Ann Warren and Eileen Brennan, and was released with three possible endings.

The former secretary of state gets the support of 52 percent of her party’s likely caucus-goers in the state, which holds the nation’s first nominating contest, while Sanders, a Senate independent and self-described socialist seeking the Democratic nomination, pulls in support from 33 percent. In May, the split was 60 percent to 15 percent. It is the first time Clinton has received less than 60 percent support in the poll, according to assistant poll director Peter A. Brown.\\n\\nWhile Clinton still has the lead for the nomination, there are still several months for Sanders to make up this deficit. Typically the Iowa polls remain quite volatile with many caucus voters not deciding until the last minute. National polls for the nomination are virtually meaningless at this point as candidates who do well in Iowa and New Hampshire typically show a major bounce after victories in the first two contests.\\n\\nSanders also had a good day campaigning in Wisconsin:\\n\\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) drew 10,000 supporters, the largest crowd of his campaign thus far, according to reports. “Tonight, we have more people at any meeting for a candidate of president of the United States than any other candidate,” Sanders told his fans at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Madison, Wis., according to The Associated Press\\n\\nGallup shows that the Democrats have regained their advantage in party affiliation:\\n\\nIn the second quarter of 2015, Democrats regained an advantage over Republicans in terms of Americans’ party affiliation. A total of 46% of Americans identified as Democrats (30%) or said they are independents who lean toward the Democratic Party (16%), while 41% identified as Republicans (25%) or leaned Republican (16%). The two parties were generally even during the previous three quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2014, when the midterm elections took place… Democratic gains in party affiliation may be partly linked to more positive views of President Barack Obama, whose job approval ratings were near his personal lows last fall but have recovered, perhaps related to low unemployment, lower gas prices than a year ago and an easing of some of the international challenges that faced the U.S., such as the Ukraine-Russia situation.',\n",

The pair allegedly left their post and drove to Calvert Vaux Park in Brooklyn, according to WPIX.\\n\\nJust after 8 p.m., the officers conducted a car stop of an Infinity Coupe driven by an 18-year-old woman with two male passengers. There was a quantity of marijuana in the front seat cup holder. The officers instructed the three occupants to step out of the car and asked if they had any drugs on them, according to the investigation. The young woman responded she had marijuana and two Klonopin pills.\\n\\nThe detectives handcuffed the woman, told her she was under arrest and would be getting a desk appearance ticket. They let her companions go and instructed them to retrieve their friend from the precinct in three hours.\\n\\nAfter leaving the park, the officers allegedly instructed the young woman to call her friends and tell them not to follow the minivan.\\n\\nMartins allegedly told the young woman he and his partner are “freaks” and asked her what she wanted to do to get out of the arrest. Martins allegedly forced the handcuffed teen to perform a sex act on him while seated in the back seat of the van as Hall drove and watched through the rear view mirror. Martins then allegedly raped the victim.\\n\\nThe detectives then stopped the van in Bay Ridge, about four miles from the park in the opposite direction of where their team was located and switched places.\\n\\nMartins got behind the wheel and Hall got into the back seat of the van, where he allegedly forced the victim to perform a sex act on him. They then drove back to the vicinity of the 60th Precinct in Coney Island and had the victim call her friends again to tell them she was being let go. They also allegedly gave her back the Klonopin pills, told her to keep her mouth shut and released her.\\n\\nThe victim told her friends what happened and, later that evening was taken to Maimonides Hospital, where a sexual assault evidence collection kit was prepared. DNA recovered from the victim was a match to both of the defendants. Video surveillance shows the victim exiting the police van at approximately 8:42 p.m.\\n\\nThe defendants were arraigned Monday before Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun on a 50-count indictment in which they are charged with first-degree rape, first-degree criminal sexual act, second-degree kidnapping, official misconduct and related counts.\\n\\nMartins was ordered held on $250,000 bail and Hall was ordered held on $150,000 bail.

              " \"You'd hardly say that the horror theme running through this series of Doctor Who has been an undercurrent, but in Mummy On The Orient Express, it bubbles right to the fore. As the Doctor tells us early on, there are many trains that have taken the name the Orient Express, but there's only one in space. And that's where we find ourselves for the vast bulk of the episode. It just happens to be the one where a Mummy is wreaking havoc.\\n\\nPenned by Jamie Mathieson, making his Doctor Who debut, Mummy On The Orient Express thus mixes in solid ingredients. There's an Agatha Christie-esque mystery, with a bunch of passengers who get drawn into what's going on. It also has a play with the Universal horror movies of old - as does director Paul Wilmshurst, who we're coming to shortly - with the Mummy itself a really convincing and impressive creation. And it chucks in Frank Skinner, playing, well, Frank Skinner in a hat, for good measure. There's a song from Foxes at the start too, for people who like songs from Foxes.\\n\\nIf it sounds like eclectic ingredients we get here, then somewhat inevitably it's a bit of an eclectic episode. It doesn't quite mash together perfectly, but you're a long way from being shortchanged. There's certainly a little dab of Voyage Of The Damned about it, but it's the central conundrum of the Mummy, what it's doing, when it's doing it and why it's doing it that remains the thrust of the episode. Time is important, too.\\n\\nWhat's disappointing - and we're treading enormously carefully to ensure we give nothing away (you can look for subtexts here as much as you like, but you won't find them) - is that it doesn't quite pick up the ramifications of the brilliant, yet divisive, Kill The Moon in the way it might have done. We're at the two-thirds stage of the series right now, but there's no sense that Doctor Who is coming in for its landing. That's not a fault of the contained story within this episode, we should note. In fact, there's an argument it's not much of a fault at all. Yet it's an inevitable reaction to the episode, after what happened last week.\\n\\nThat said, where Mummy On The Orient Express works is as a good, mainly standalone episode of Doctor Who. It's one that could have easily sat earlier in the run as here quite happily enough, but that's no problem. Capaldi holds this one together, and the main guest star, the aforementioned Skinner, isn't likely to trouble the BAFTAs, but is clearly part of the fun.\\n\\nOne person who should trouble the BAFTAs though is Paul Wilmshurst. Doctor Who series 8 hasn't been shy of very strong directors, but his work in this episode and Kill The Moon is of real merit. Mark him as a name to watch, because all the signs are there that he has a good feature or two in his future. More from him in Who as well please.\\n\\nWe'd like more from Jamie Mathieson too. He keeps his story contained, cares about what he's referencing, and puts together a good, solid 45 minute horror puzzle. At times not out of place in Russell T Davies' era of the show, Mummy On The Orient Express occasionally chugs, but still works perfectly well. Capaldi also remains one of the best casting decisions Doctor Who has made in some time.\\n\\nFollow our Twitter feed for faster news and bad jokes right here. And be our Facebook chum here.\",\n",

              " 'American and Russian astronauts use separate water filtration systems on ISS, as Nasa astronauts also collect Russian urine when available to increase supply\\n\\nWhat’s the difference between American and Russian astronauts on the International Space Station? The Americans drink their urine, the Russians don’t.\\n\\n“It tastes like bottled water,” Layne Carter, water subsystem manager for the ISS at Nasa’s Marshall Space Flight Center told Bloomberg. “As long as you can psychologically get past the point that it’s recycled urine and condensate that comes out of the air.”\\n\\nCondensate is the collected breath and sweat of the crew, shower runoff, and urine from animals on board the station. Specifically, 12 mice that came with the Japanese cargo ship, the Kounotori 5 or White Stork, that successfully docked on Monday.\\n\\nNinety-three percent of all the water on board is reclaimed, according to a video posted by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield while he was on the space station in 2013.\\n\\n“We can recycle about 6,000 extra liters of water for the station each year,” Hadfield said.\\n\\nWhile the Americans are the only ones who filter their urine, both sets of astronauts gather condensate from the air. They have separate water systems and have never agreed on how to filter their water, according to Bloomberg.\\n\\nSince the launch of the Soviet Mir space station in 1986, the Russians have used silver in its ionic form. Nasa has made use of iodine since 1981, when the space shuttle program began. The Americans plan to start using silver since it doesn’t have to be filtered out before consumption, but Carter said he likes that the Americans and Russians employ different methods.\\n\\n“It really makes a lot of sense to have dissimilar redundancies in the space station in case one of the systems has problems,” Carter told Bloomberg.\\n\\nThe station also has approximately 2,000 liters of backup water in case of an emergency. The water is split between the American and Russian sections of the station.\\n\\nBut the US water recycling system produces more than the Russians’ does. Nasa astronauts don’t just filter their own urine – they also use their Russian colleagues’.\\n\\n“We collect it in bags, and then the crew hauls it over to the US side,” Carter told Bloomberg. “We don’t do 100% of the Russian urine. It depends on our time availability.”\\n\\nIn Hadfield’s video, he defended the consumption of filtered urine and condensate.\\n\\n“Before you cringe at the thought of drinking your leftover wash water and your leftover urine, keep in mind that the water that we end up with is purer than most of the water that you drink at home,” he said. “That makes the International Space Station its own self-contained environment. That’s a critical step towards living for long periods off of planet Earth.”',\n",
              " '400 radical-left activists were arrested in Stuttgart today as they attempted to prevent the Alternative for Germany (AfD) from starting their annual conference, at which they are to thrash out the contents of their Spring manifesto.\\n\\nScenes of violence were witnessed this morning as members of the anarchist so-called ‘black bloc’ movement clashed with police and assaulted members of the AfD. The protestors received warnings from the police about their behaviour, but after fireworks and lit flares were thrown at officers, they deployed water cannon and pepper spray, reports Kronen Zeitung.\\n\\nAround 1,000 protestors arrived at the Stuttgart convention centre this morning, and were matched by some 1,000 members of the German police. The leftists formed human chains to prevent delegates from entering the centre, effectively delaying the start of the conference by an hour. Police said there were no injuries among the “violent” masked protesters.\\n\\nAs one leftist agitator explained to English language television, “We are united by our conviction that we cannot let the AfD go unchallenged… we will not allow ourselves to be divided and we stand together for a compassionate society”.\\n\\nUnderlining this compassion, protesters threw water at police horses, set fire to tyres, and attacked AfD members with coloured paint.\\n\\nAfD were meeting on the first day of their two day conference to adopt the young parties first national programme — a Spring manifesto. Some 2,400 members were eventually able to enter the hall and enter debates, and vote.\\n\\nWhat is decided upon for the programme will set the future course of action, and direction of travel for the party. Agreed early on in the day was statement by party deputy chairman Beatrix von Storch, former Duchess of Oldenburg, that referring to the political interpretation of the faith “Islam is not part of Germany”, reports Die Welt.\\n\\nParty leader Frauke Petry emphasised that while the party was not Islamophobic, Islam itself was fundementally with Germany’s constitution — the so-called Fundamental Law.\\n\\nAlso discussed was the AfD’s support for German culture, the traditional family, and Germany leaving the Euro single currency. The conference will resume on Sunday.\\n\\nGermany’s AfD has long been the only seriously dissenting voice in the country over the migrant crisis. Having transformed from a niche political movement opposing the Euro single currency and the European Union, it has enjoyed record poll ratings and electoral success in the past 12 months as their anti mass migration policies have caught the the attention of many Germans.\\n\\nAs with many right-wing movements in Europe, AfD’s members have been dismissed as the ‘losers of globalisation’ — societies less educated and less wealthy who have suffered most from mass migration. Yet new research published today by Germany’s mainstream centrist newspaper Die Welt has found that counter the stereotype, AfD supporters are actually among the richest of any politically active group in Germany, and among the best educated.',\n",
              " 'San Antonio FC has continued to get the job done, extending their undefeated streak, all be it in unspectacular fashion as they managed a scoreless draw against Oklahoma City Energy FC at Taft Stadium on Saturday night.\\n\\nThe result takes San Antonio FC’s undefeated streak to 13 matches, and extends goalkeeper Diego Restrepo’s clean sheet streak to seven matches. Restrepo now has gone over 10 hours of play without conceding a goal, but the team is still struggling at the other end of the park.\\n\\nSan Antonio FC head coach Darren Powell was pleased with another clean sheet after the match saying “That makes seven clean sheets in a row, which is something that takes a lot of hard work and effort from every player. There’s a lot to build on and we earned another point on the road, and now we look to keep improving week after week.”\\n\\nIn truth there was little for either keeper to do in the match with just a combined shots on target mark of three. Two of those fell to Oklahoma City Energy as Restrepo was able to make two fairly comfortable saves.\\n\\n“It’s good to keep getting clean sheets and giving our team a chance to earn at least a point every match.” Said Restrepo, “it’s great to continue recording shutouts but the important thing is to come away with results, and now we just have to keep improving.”\\n\\nAgain the San Antonio defense was impressive as they held out the Energy blocking two shots. San Antonio FC again lost the possession battle, but just barely, but they were rarely troubled thanks to a strong defensive performance, with Stephen McCarthy particularly impressive, making nine clearances and intercepting two passes.\\n\\nThe continued lack of finishing touch will worry San Antonio FC, who for the second straight week were able to create chances but not put any of them away. That will concern Powell at least slightly, but despite frustration up front\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",

              " 'Lake Shore, the Jersey Shore-esque reality show based in Toronto, has just released its first webisode. Featuring a look at the audition process, one can only guess that this three-minute peek is designed to drum up some attention for a production that\\'s \"still in negotiations\" regarding television distribution.\\n\\nAnd a peek it is. Given that the members of the cast have yet to be selected, we mostly get to see people trying their best to look like they\\'re partying hard, despite the early hour of the auditions.\\n\\nBoasting about how very colourful everyone is, the show\\'s host, Susie Iliyan, walks us through a few forced interviews with those hoping to make the cut. Highlights include a dude flexing his pecs, multiple people offering un-ironic duckfaces, others sticking out their tongues (that means you\\'re confident, you know...), and a healthy dose of cleavage thrown in for good measure.\\n\\nThe whole thing is a tad painful to watch, which, I suspect, is mostly the point. When one tunes into shows like Jersey Shore, it\\'s precisely for such cringe-inducing moments. Intentional or not, people are captivated by such \"drama\" because it implicitly confirms their cultural and intellectual superiority. It wouldn\\'t be a stretch to say that this is the primary reason for the wild popularity of reality television in general.\\n\\nSo instead of railing about how dumb everyone looks and lamenting how hard they\\'re trying to look cool, the only complaint I really have with this first glimpse of the show is that it appears to fit into that old arc in which a Canadian show does a shitty job of copying an already popular U.S. production (JacLife meet the Hills).\\n\\nPotentially more troublesome, however, is the show\\'s desire \"to answer the question what happens when eight vibrant and volatile twenty-something Torontonians from different backgrounds, cultures and sexual orientations shack up?\"\\n\\nIs this really a question that requires answering? Doesn\\'t this happen all the time? Sure these will be eight strangers, but lines like this give the distinct sense that those responsible for Lake Shore hope that some sort of racial or cultural tension will fuel the drama of the show.\\n\\nThe saving grace of Jersey Shore, on the other hand, is that the characters\\' collective cultural background is treated as lightheartedly as it is stereotypically.\\n\\nIt\\'s doubtful that a similar dynamic is possible with Lake Shore. Hypothetically speaking, if each cast member were selected to function as a cultural stereotype, the result would be anything but a representation of Toronto\\'s diversity.\\n\\nQuite the opposite. To be a young urbanite living in Toronto is to be disinterested in what ensues when people of diverse backgrounds are put together under one roof. We already know the answer. Nothing much out of the ordinary, and certainly not a whole bunch of cultural-racial high jinks.',\n",

Other crew members - commander, flight engineer and flight attendant - were killed.”\\n\\nThe United Nations confirmed three crew members had been killed and one was being treated for injuries, but it had no immediate comment on the Russian report that the helicopter, which was on a routine cargo flight, had been shot down.\\n\\nThe U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said an investigative team would arrive at the crash site on Wednesday.\\n\\nA spokesman for the Russian embassy in Sudan, Artur Safukov, told Russia’s state broadcaster Rossiya 24 that all four on board were Russian citizens.\\n\\nThe Mi-8 helicopter crashed about 10 km (6 miles) south of Bentiu, the capital of oil-producing Unity State, which lies in the north of the Africa’s newest nation, UNMISS said.\\n\\nToby Lanzer, the officer-in-charge of UNMISS, and UTair both said the helicopter, which was contracted to the U.N. mission, had been flying from Wau in the southwest to Bentiu in the north.\\n\\nUTair, which said it has been working with the United Nations since 1991, said it was temporary halting flying over the area.\\n\\nFighting has often flared in Unity State as rivals battle to control vital oilfields. The conflict has pitted soldiers loyal to President Salva Kiir against troops backing the former deputy president, Riek Machar. Despite two ceasefire pacts, fighting has continued.\\n\\nThe rebel delegation at peace talks in Ethiopia issued a statement denying what it said was South Sudanese government accusations that rebel forces brought down the helicopter.\\n\\n“The area in which the (aircraft) was reportedly shot down is government-held territory, if indeed the aircraft was shot down,” the rebel statement said.\\n\\nThe U.N force, set up after South Sudan’s independence in 2011, has been seeking to protect civilians. At least 10,000 people have been killed in the fighting, which has driven the nation to the brink of a “man-made” famine.\\n\\nPeace talks in Ethiopia have made little significant progress. The United States and European Union have imposed sanctions on commanders from both sides and regional African states sponsoring negotiations have threatened punitive measures against those impeding talks, but to little avail.\\n\\nInitially set up to protect civilians as well as carry out other state-building work, the UNMISS peacekeepers were authorized by the U.N.

Later yesterday evening, Ferry was fined $15,000 by the NBA for \"inappropriate interaction with the game officials following the game.\" According to ESPN, Ferry approached the refs and handed them a DVD of Rondo bumping Mott. They watched it, passed it along to the league, and discipline chief Stu Jackson had no choice but to suspend Rondo.

The new initiatives come as Maduro\\'s approval ratings have plunged into the low 30 percent range, and his party prepares for congressional elections next year.\\n\\nMaduro recently announced that his administration had taken over warehouses where \"bourgeois criminals\" were hoarding food and medical supplies.

By contrast the continuous monitoring systems are spread across 104 cities and towns.\\n\\nThe equipment for continuous monitoring costs around Rs 2 crores including the cost of operation and maintenance for 5-10 years. By contrast conventional monitoring equipment costs only around Rs 1 lakh, according to industry sources.\\n\\nThe drawback of manual systems is that generating useful data is very time consuming, because there is human intervention, but they are much easier to maintain and operate, according to experts.\\n\\nContinuous monitoring is useful when there are hazardous emissions involved as was the case with the Union Carbide tragedy when methyl isocyanate leaked into the atmosphere, because they can capture spikes in emissions in real time.\\n\\nD Saha, who heads the Air quality lab at the CPCB, said that automatic, real time, unmanned and instantaneous information is useful for preventive action, but said that automated system cannot be used for detailed chemical analysis. They are used to complement the manual monitoring system, he explained.\\n\\nAir quality data is available for the public through the SAFAR app and also the SAMEER app developed by the CPCB.\\n\\nLatest data on air pollution from India’s apex pollution regulator shows that air pollution, in terms of PM10 (particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter) has worsened in 8 out of 10 metros between 2013 and 2016, including in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.\\n\\nFirst Published: Sep 22, 2017 14:08 IST',\n",

              " '\\n\\nSome bikes always seem to be customized in a certain way: Many of the CB750s and Bonnevilles we see are hard to tell apart.\\n\\nThe same type of cognitive inertia applies to Moto Guzzis, which often follow the style perfected by Kaffeemaschine. But here’s a very, very different Guzzi, from João Barranca of Redonda Motors.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão hails from Coimbra, Portugal, and runs his workshop after hours. This is the second Redonda build we’ve featured, after his amazing Metisse-inspired Husaberg, and we’re now wondering if it’s time he went pro.\\n\\nThis time around, João was in the mood for something Italian. So he sourced the Mille GT and got stuck in.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I always liked Italian motorcycles,” he tells us. “I think they are different from all others.” (The Mille GT is certainly different, being a short-lived, late 80s hybrid of the T5 and California.)\\n\\n“For me, an Italian motorcycle must have some fine lines, should have style, must be fast and invoke racing.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBack in the day, the Mille GT’s 948cc engine was specc’d at 67 hp. Adequate, but hardly exciting—so João decided to remedy this.\\n\\nHe started by lightening up the flywheel and upgrading the distribution system with a more modern version. It hasn’t really squeezed any more horses out of the Guzzi, but it’s changed how it behaves: “Now the engine gets up to speed very quickly—like a real race bike.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther improvements include a new set of Keihin FCR40 carbs, and an external oil filter kit to facilitate maintenance. The exhaust system is custom—meticulously designed for optimal performance and to “create beautiful bass.”\\n\\nThe bike’s a little easier to ride now too, thanks to a Hebo hydraulic clutch. And João’s gone to the trouble of rewiring it with modern components—like a Motogadget m-Unit, Dyna III ignition, a lithium-ion battery, new coils, and a new alternator and rectifier.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe suspension’s all new, with upside-down Showa forks up front, and a pair of Öhlins shocks out back. João retained the stock rear disc brake, but upgraded the front with 6-piston calipers, a Nissin radial pump and two 330mm discs.\\n\\nHe’s kept the stock 18-inch wheels too, for a classic feel, but fitted Maxxis Promaxx Street rubber, a high-performance bias ply design.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão’s done well to take the Mille GT from rundown beater to daily runner, but he’s given it a dash of style too. The bodywork is intriguing and spacious—this is a ‘Grand Tourer,’ after all.\\n\\nUp top is the original tank, modified for a racier effect, and fitted with dual filler caps as a nod to old endurance racers. New fenders at both ends complete the bodywork.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe front fairing/headlight combo is a little unconventional, but we still dig it. Behind it is a new speedo and a set of clip-ons.\\n\\nThe tailpiece is a one-off, made from fiberglass to match the tank’s proportions. Inspiration for the dual taillights came from Italian sports cars of the 80s.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Moto Guzzi is sprinkled with lovely details, and wrapped up with sublime paint and pinstriping.\\n\\n“The color scheme was inspired by the Moto Guzzi brand colors,” explains João, “but in different tones, in order to make the bike elegant and distinct.”\\n\\n\\n\\nElegant and distinct is right: this old Guzzi has all the right junk in all the right places. And these days, you can pick up a Mille GT for a couple of Gs—probably half the price of a decent Le Mans.\\n\\nNow that’s got us thinking …\\n\\nRedonda Motors | Facebook | Instagram | Images by Bernardo Lúcio',\n",

Fred Buckman, formerly of Consumers Power, PacifiCorp and Shaw Group will replace Rick Wills as chairman of the board.\\n\\nA handful of teams around the world are pursuing fusion technology as a way to provide carbon-free power that produces little waste and has minuscule fuel requirements by recreating here on earth the fusion reaction that fuels the sun.\\n\\nThe task is anything but easy. The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project in France has already cost $14 billion and will not produce a full-blown fusion reaction until 2027. The project is run by a seven-nation consortium.\\n\\n“When it comes to innovation, bigger is not always better,” said Mowry, the newly appointed CEO. “You only need to look at the aerospace industry and the success that Elon Musk and his SpaceX startup have had in creating reusable rockets. NASA was unable to achieve that in half a century with tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars.”\\n\\nGeneral Fusion’s reactor works by containing hydrogen plasma fuel in magnetic suspension and then compressing it with an array of massive pistons, which pushes the temperature of the fuel to 150 million degrees Celsius. The trick is to create a fusion reaction — merging the nuclei of hydrogen atoms — that releases more energy than it takes to create.\\n\\nThe piston-based reactor is designed to create bursts of energy lasting thousandths of a second, rather than maintaining a continuous plasma reaction with enormous energy requirements like some larger projects.\\n\\n“When you look across the fusion landscape, there are some interesting ideas, but I have a tough time seeing how they translate into a practical power plant,” Mowry said. “General Fusion’s approach makes this more of a solvable problem.”\\n\\nHeat recovered from the bursts in the GF reactor is used to generate electricity in the same way as conventional nuclear power plants, but without the long-lasting radioactive waste.\\n\\nGeneral Fusion and its partners — including Chrysalix Energy, GrowthWorks Capital, Cenovus Energy, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and the sovereign wealth fund of Malaysia among others — have already sunk about $100 million into the project.\\n\\n“We are about to transition from a lab-scale type of development to an integrated prototype, a demonstration machine, so the company will step up to the next level and the financing we require will increase commensurately,” said Mowry.\\n\\nThe dollar value of the next round of financing will be determined as GF management “sharpens its pencils” and maps out the next stage of the engineering and development program over the next three to six months.\\n\\nrshore@postmedia.com',\n",

              " 'What’s propelling China’s industrial robot revolution\\n\\nXi Jinping, China’s President, last year called for an “industrial robot revolution.” Since then China has created policies giving value added tax refunds and subsidies to companies making robots, and robot user companies can qualify for tax breaks.\\n\\nThe Financial Times reported that analysts are forecasting the payback period for industrial robots with a 10 yr life cycle is 1.7 yrs in 2015, down from 11.8 yrs in 2008 and will likely shorten again to 1.3 years in 2016.\\n\\nThe prospect of being able to pay off the cost of a robot in slightly more than a year, Goldman Sachs says, has brought industrial automation to within the reach of China’s millions of small and medium-sized manufacturers, creating the conditions for a productivity surge.\\n\\nThese two factors (the mandate to use robots and the lower payback metrics) combined with “shrinkage in China’s working age population and the numbers of workers available for production line work” are likely to propel the continued deployment of robots in China and contribute to the huge surge in robot sales in China (as can be seen in the FT chart) and International Federation of Robotics (IFR) statistical data. Further contributing to China’s labor shortage is an elevation in levels of education attainment in young working age adults, causing them to seek non-factory work.\\n\\nTwo recent research reports by ResearchinChina and Huidian Research attest to China’s growing need for robotics across the manufacturing spectrum, from the auto industry to craft breweries. These reports, and others, forecast that by 2017, more industrial robots will be operating in China’s production plants than in the EU or North America. It is expected that global industrial robot sales will grow from 200,000 in 2014 to 400,000 by 2017!\\n\\nAt next week’s big CIROS Show in Shanghai, on July 7th, a joint IFR-CRIA (Chinese Robotics Industry Alliance) roundtable discussion on Innovation on Robot Applications, will also provide a forum where the IFR will present their preliminary industrial robotics recap for the year 2014, which will confirm the radical growth in China’s robot population. The IFR’s annual World Robotics Industrial Robots report for 2015 covering 2014 results will be released this fall and is a worthwhile purchase.\\n\\nIn other news, a recent message to shareholders, Foxconn’s chairman said that he plans to reduce Foxconn’s pressing need to recruit, hire and train up to 30% of their 1.3 million workforce by replacing dull, dirty, ergonomically stressful, and dangerous tasks with robots within the next few years.

Nugent said, “Then they see an administration that is spitting on the US Constitution, the Ten Commandments, the Bill of Rights and the Golden Rule.”\\n\\nMedia Matters:\\n\\nNugent said, “Everybody I hang with the ranchers, the farmers, the cops, the teachers, everybody I hang with, they got an alarm clock. They get up they put their heart and soul into the being the very best they can be. They want to be an asset to their families, their neighborhood. They want to be the best they can be. They want to be productive members of society, and then they see an administration that is spitting on the US Constitution, the Ten Commandments, the Bill of Rights and the Golden Rule, so we the tea parties, we the people who are speaking up, I’m gonna quote my hero Dr. Martin Luther King, we who engage in non violent direct action are not the cause of tension, but rather bring it to the surface a tension that already exists. That’s the job of we the people to be watchdogs and whistleblowers. The government works for us. They’re absolutely out of control. The Tea Party, and what you stand for Sean, and I stand for, one big a-word, accountability. That’s our money, at least be honest and accountable.”\\n\\nTed Nugent has now become a non violent pacifist, but this video demonstrates otherwise:\\n\\nIn case you could not understand the audio, Nugent said, “I was in Chicago last week I said—Hey Obama, you might want to suck on one of these you punk? Obama, he’s a piece of shit and I told him to suck on one of my machine guns… Let’s hear it for them. I was in NY and I said hey Hillary—you might want to ride one of these into the sunset you worthless bitch… Since I’m in California, I’m gonna find- she might wanna suck on my machine gun! Hey, Dianne Feinstein, ride one of these you worthless whore. Any questions? Freeeeedom!”\\n\\nNugent is one to talk about accountability, when he has no semblance of it in his own life. The same man who was sitting with Sean Hannity discussing accountability once had to be hauled into court because he was a deadbeat dad who refused to support his illegitimate child, or how about Nugent admitting that he is a coward, who chickened his way out of serving his country in Vietnam? There is an a-word that comes to mind when I think of Ted Nugent, and it isn’t accountability. I can also think of an h-word, hypocrite.\\n\\nMuch like all of the other right wingers, Nugent is outraged that Obama is taking away God and freedom, yet he can’t name any freedoms that have been taken away or any instance where God has been lost. Ted Nugent’s little rant to Sean Hannity gives us a chance to point out that the Tea Party is nothing new. The same things that Nugent said about Obama were said about Bill Clinton in the 1990s, Ted Kennedy in the 1980s, Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, heck some of these things were even said about John F. Kennedy in the 1960s, and before him, FDR.

              " 'PROVO — The ceremony for seniors that annually precedes BYU\\'s final home football game should have an exception this year.\\n\\nAs a fifth-year senior, Taysom Hill would still have one year of eligibility left for next season if he chooses to return. If the often-injured quarterback, who has been sidelined since the first game, declines the opportunity to keep playing then this year would be his last as a college football player.\\n\\nEither way, BYU should proceed as if Hill\\'s time in the program has ended. When Hill\\'s name is announced and he receives his senior blanket, the home crowd should extend a rousing applause as part of a thank you and goodbye.\\n\\nAs harsh as it sounds, BYU football needs to move on from Hill. The reality is, Tanner Mangum is BYU\\'s quarterback of the present and the future.\\n\\n\"The best-case scenario for Taysom is we might award two (senior blankets),\" coach Bronco Mendenhall said this week. \"When in doubt we\\'ll award extras. If we\\'re not sure what someone is going to do we\\'ll give them one, and if they want to come back they don\\'t have to give it back and we\\'ll give them another.\"\\n\\nNot scheduled to talk the future with Hill until after the season, Mendenhall can\\'t say what the future holds for the quarterback. Here\\'s where Mendenhall needs to make the tough decision in the program\\'s best interests, like he did the last two times in recent years in firing several coaches on the offensive staff.\\n\\nRelated:\\n\\nMangum or Hill in 2016? If Taysom Hill decides to play football for BYU in 2016 who should start: Hill or Tanner Mangum? Here are arguments for each quarterback.\\n\\nA wildly talented player, Hill has not been able to stay healthy in three of the last four seasons. After suffering a season-ending injury in the fifth game last season Hill went down in the opener this year. He also lost his freshman year to an injury in midseason.\\n\\nTo count on anything from Hill next season would be foolish and also irresponsible to the rest of the team. The time to part ways is now, allowing Hill enough time to seek opportunities elsewhere if he wants.\\n\\n\"He\\'s going to want to play quarterback, and I\\'m not certain that\\'s the right thing for BYU, quite frankly, at this moment,\" said former BYU offensive coordinator Brandon Doman, who was fired two years ago.\\n\\n\"I would recommend for BYU to get Tanner ready to go the next three years and prepare to have a real stable environment at quarterback. He\\'s not going to be suspect to injury like Taysom is because he\\'s not running around.\"\\n\\nWhile playing time always should be earned, Mangum doesn\\'t need to be looking over his shoulder next season. It\\'s best for the team for him to go into the offseason as the designated starting quarterback, with others vying for the back-up position.\\n\\nDistant and recent history also has proven BYU\\'s offense works best with a pass-first quarterback as opposed to a dual-threat. Even with Hill putting up eye-popping statistics at times, BYU was only 8-5 during the season he remained healthy.\\n\\nRiley Nelson, who as a dual-threat in the mode of Hill, also battled injury issues during his time as a starter. BYU averaged almost 11 wins a season during the four years that pass-first quarterbacks John Beck and Max Hall started.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t to suggest Hill should quit even if he wants to keep playing. As a graduate student, he could transfer and be immediately eligible to play next season.\\n\\nOne possibility could be playing for Jim Harbaugh at Michigan, which starts a senior quarterback who transferred in for this season. Hill signed to play for Harbaugh at Stanford but never went there and transferred upon returning from a church mission after the coach left to take over for the San Francisco 49ers.\\n\\n\"I would tell Taysom to do the best thing for Taysom,\" Doman said. \"If Michigan comes knocking and you\\'ve got a fifth opportunity to play quarterback for Jim Harbaugh, and that\\'s the best thing for Taysom Hill then he should go do that for sure.\"\\n\\n×\\n\\nRelated Stories',\n",

Hillar never held such a position, it said, but had been enlisted in U.S. Coast Guard Reserve in the 1960’s. Hillar also falsely claimed, said the FBI, that he was an expert in human trafficking and the film Taken was based on his experiences in recovering his daughter from kidnappers.\\n\\nIn addition to the prison sentence, Hillar was also ordered to pay restitution of $171,415 and perform 500 community hours at the Maryland State Veterans Cemeteries.\\n\\nAccording to court documents, from around 1998 to 2010, private and public sector organizations paid Hillar at least $171,415 for teaching, leading workshops, giving speeches and conducting training on counter terrorism, drugs trafficking, human trafficking and related topics, said the agency. Hillar conducted these activities through a business named “Bill Hillar Training.” Court documents said most of Hillar’s victims were military, law enforcement or first responder organizations.\\n\\nIn order to get consulting jobs with these organizations, Hillar said in resumes, biographical statements, and on the Internet that he was a retired U.S. Army Colonel who had acquired diverse training and experience included tactical counter-terrorism, explosive ordnance, emergency medicine and psychological warfare serving in Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. He also said he received a Ph.D. from the University of Oregon.\\n\\nHillar never served in the U.S. Army or the Special Forces and never attained the rank of Colonel, said the FBI, nor did he serve in Asia, the Middle East and Central and South America. He didn’t acquire any counter-terrorism, explosive ordnance, emergency medicine and psychological warfare in those areas, it said. Hillar did serve in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve as an enlisted sailor from 1962 to 1970, achieving the rate of Radarman, Petty Officer Third Class.\\n\\nAccording to court documents, the organizations Hillar purported to train perform critical public safety and national security functions, and require ongoing training and education in order to respond to new and changing threats. Hillar, who was not qualified, displaced qualified teachers and trainers, thereby putting members of our military, law enforcement and first responders at risk, said the FBI\\n\\nAdditionally, the FBI said Hillar fabricated a gruesome tale that his own daughter had been kidnapped, forced into sex slavery, sodomized and tortured before being hacked to death with machetes and thrown into the sea. He further claimed that this experience and his life story was the basis for the 2008 film “Taken”. The significant press attention that film generated, in turn, generated free press for his business. Hillar admitted he fabricated the story about his daughter, who was alive and well.\\n\\n“William G. Hillar claimed that he had earned praise as a hero, but the truth is that he deserves condemnation as a liar,” said U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein. “He did not serve in the U.S. Army, did not receive military training in counter-terrorism and psychological warfare, and did not lose his daughter to sex traffickers.”\\n\\n“Mr. Hillar’s fraudulent representations came to the FBI’s attention from concerned citizens, including former members of the Special Forces community. This investigation is an example of the difficulty the public faces trying to verify the accuracy of information on the Internet,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Richard McFeely.\\n\\nhttp://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/24375',\n",

We applaud District Attorney Garnett for respecting the will of the voters, and we hope his colleagues across the state will follow his lead,” Tvert said. “We do not see why District Attorney Morrissey or any other prosecutor would want to continue seeking criminal penalties for conduct that will be legal in the next month or so.”\\n\\nProsecutors in some Washington counties, where marijuana legalization also passed, have also dropped pending pot possession prosecutions.\\n\\nTags: Amendment 64',\n",

Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall.

Recently, Israel adopted a demand for transparency, as is custom in other democracies. Israel requests an explanation from the Foreign Ministry.”\\n\\nMartin Schäfer, the German spokesman, said at a press conference in mid-June, “Hungary thus joins the ranks of countries like Russia, China and Israel, which obviously regard the funding of nongovernmental organizations, of civil society efforts, by donors from abroad as a hostile or at least an unfriendly act.” He criticized Hungary because the Central European state’s new NGO law obligates foreign nonprofits to register their status.When asked at the press conference about Israel’s “angry” reaction to the parallel drawn with Russia and China on Friday, Schäfer said: “I can’t report of any [Israeli] reactions to the Foreign Ministry. I don’t know... I don’t know anything about that.”Israel’s 2016 NGO law requires nonprofit organizations that receive more than half of their funding from foreign governments to report this fact each year to the registrar in the Justice Ministry.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this month he wants to make the NGO transparency law stricter. Critics view the current NGO law as an infringement on civil liberties.Bundestag deputies slammed Schäfer’s anti-Israel statements, the Bild reported.Lawmaker Thomas Feist of the Christian Democratic Union said likening Israel to China and Russia is “divorced from reality,” and the comparison “is damaging for the bilateral relationship between Germany and Israel.”Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for the CDU/CSU parties in the Bundestag, said: “Such a comparison is insensitive.We should make it unambiguously clear who Germany’s partners and allies are – the free democratic, constitutional states.And, without question, Israel and Hungary belong to those states, not China and today’s Russia.”Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who is a Social Democrat, has faced criticism for an increased hostility toward Israel. He has previously called Israel an “apartheid regime” and last month hosted an Iranian cleric who called for Israel’s destruction.Gabriel declined to meet Netanyahu’s request to cancel meetings during his recent visit to Israel with two NGOs critical of the government. As a result, Netanyahu pulled the plug on his meeting with Gabriel.Netanyahu snubs German minister over plan to meet far - left groups like Breaking the Silence (credit: REUTERS)At the start of Gabriel’s visit to Israel in April, he authored a controversial opinion piece that played down the significance of the Holocaust.When asked about Gabriel’s comments, a spokesman for the German ministry told The Jerusalem Post: “It is goes without saying: Foreign Minister Gabriel and the Foreign Ministry are against every form of antisemitism.”\\n\\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

And while sushi covers all the flavors of the ocean and even some less traditional meaty options, ramen remains a steady choice between four main soup stocks: miso, soy sauce, pork and salt.\\n\\nOf course, more individualistic and unnatural ramen shops exist around Japan, but never before had we heard of a ramen restaurant specializing in sea urchin ramen.\\n\\nUntil now.\\n\\nJapan and especially Tokyo is a mecca for foodies. But wandering the streets looking for a good place to eat will quickly overwhelm you. Located in the heart of Shibuya, we can thank our good friends at Another Tokyo, for finding this needle in a haystack. The ramen shop is called Tairyo Makoto (大漁まこと), which means “Big Catch Makoto”. Sounds like a place that has a lot of seafood!\\n\\nThe menu won’t let you down, as you don’t often see ramen featuring clam, lobster and crab, so perhaps we are witnessing the birth of a new fishy fad.

              " 'How Looper Works\\n\\nFirst off, go see Looper. One of the best movies I’ve seen. Spoilers follow.\\n\\nOK, let’s start by explaining how a looper’s career is supposed to look. You get hired as a looper, spend your time sitting in a corn field shooting people, eventually shoot yourself and get a big payday, live off of it for thirty more years, then get kidnapped and sent back in time and shot by yourself. Notice that this is a stable timeloop: young you grows old, goes back in time, gets shot by young you, who grows old, goes back in time, gets shot by young you, who grows old … etc.\\n\\nBut time travel doesn’t eliminate free will. We see this with the case of Seth (Paul Dano / Frank Brennan). Instead of shooting Old Seth, Young Seth decides to let him escape. This too is a stable timeloop: young Seth grows old, goes back in time, escapes, lives in hiding while young Seth grows old, goes back in time, escapes, lives in hiding while … .\\n\\nBut other characters have free will too: young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) decides to give young Seth up. The gang cuts off one of young Seth’s fingers, pushing him into a new timeloop: young Seth gets caught, loses one of his fingers, goes back in time, escapes, while young Seth gets caught, loses one of his fingers, goes back in time, escapes, etc. With each new choice by the gang to let old Seth change young Seth’s future (and thus old Seth’s past), we head into a new timeloop, where old Seth has a different past (and thus different memories and different missing limbs).\\n\\nIn the first main timeloop (shown second in the movie, via a flashback), young Joe shoots old Joe, goes to China, becomes an unusually-talented agent of violence, finds true love, is kidnapped and sent back in time, and gets killed by young Joe, who goes on to do the same thing. This too is a nice stable timeloop.\\n\\nBut on one of these runs through the loop, old Joe manages to overpower the guards and, while he does go back in time, he manages to keep young Joe from killing him. He escapes into the field, finds the location of young Cid, then comes back to shoot Cid’s mother while Cid escapes into field and stows away on a train. Cid grows up to be the Rainmaker and Joe grows old. Cid’s henchmen murder old Joe’s wife but are overpowered by old Joe, who goes back in time to try again to kill Cid, who again escapes to become the Rainmaker and kill Joe’s wife. This too is a stable timeloop, although we see some of it only in speculative flash-forwards (I’ll explain why in a moment).\\n\\nWhich timeloop are we watching? Well, we’re watching the story of a particular instance of Joe, who we’ll call Movie Joe. Movie Joe only exists, however, because of a choice made by Flashback Joe (the Joe we see in the flashback that begins when Movie Joe is falling from his apartment). Flashback Joe is born, grows up, decides to give up Seth, closes his own loop, grows old, overpowers the henchmen, goes back in time, knocks out Movie Joe, hunts down Cid, and is about to kill Cid’s mother.\\n\\nBut Flashback Joe is not the protagonist of the film. The protagonist is Movie Joe. Movie Joe is born, grows up, decides to give up Seth, fails to close his loop, goes to protect Cid. Normally, young Joe fails and heads into a timeloop where Cid stows away on the train and becomes the Rainmaker. But Movie Joe somehow is able to foresee this future and concludes the only way to prevent it is to kill himself. Since he dies there, he never grows old and never goes back in time, leading to a timeline where Flashback Joe doesn’t ever exist. Note, this is not a stable timeloop (because Movie Joe only kills himself to stop Flashback Joe, who can’t exist if Movie Joe kills himself) but instead just a garden-variety timeline. In this timeline, presumably, Sarah keeps Cid from growing evil and everything ends happily ever after.\\n\\nNext week we’ll explain Primer.\\n\\nYou should follow me on twitter here.\\n\\nOctober 8, 2012',\n",
              " 'Snapchat Is at It Again and Blocks Root Users — but for How Long?\\n\\nDespite many security concerns from the past, Snapchat is still one of the most popular social media service available for smartphones. According to reports, it has 100 million of active users, and 65% of them upload photos.\\n\\nSnapchat users would easily become the 13th biggest country in the world if we take population as a measure.\\n\\nSnapchat’s fast way of sharing photos to multiple friends at the time is highly regarded by users. However, many of you, Snapchat users will soon face, if not already, a serious inconvenience, as Snapchat will stop working on your devices. Yes, Snapchat will not work on rooted devices.\\n\\nThe newest update brings a new security check. The application is now looking for superuser existence in the system upon logging in. A nice explanation of the problem was made by XDA Senior Member MaaarZ, who is also a creator of Snapprefs, an Xposed Framework module which enhances the limited Snapchat’s utility. According to MaaarZ, Snapchat is now performing a few tests and if at least one of them is positive, an application kills itself when Superuser is found in the system. Needless to say that most of currently available custom ROMs on XDA contain root, so this change may affect thousands if not millions of people.\\n\\nLooking from user’s perspective, the security should always be kept at the highest level. Blocking application on rooted devices is nevertheless an extremely poor move. Thousands of users will look for an alternative instead of keeping their devices in vanilla state. The social media market is very tight and it’s extremely easy to find a nice replacement without such ridiculous obstacles. I bet that many developers or companies are looking forward to delivering a similar, better-written software alternative with all users in mind, which will fill the gap in no time.\\n\\nI’m not a security expert, so I’ve asked our very own Senior Recognized Developer pulser_g2 to share his opinion regarding this move. Here’s what he had to say:\\n\\nAny application which tries to enforce client-side security, as part of its core use-case, is fundamentally flawed. If you are delivering the data to the user, they have it, and you must assume they have it forever. If this was a hobbyist’s “fun” project, it would be acceptable – OK sure, someone can screenshot images, or store them, but that’s fair enough. This isn’t a hobby app though, and it’s trying to do something unachievable. They want to implement DRM on a still image, when even the content producers haven’t managed to make effective DRM. Music labels gave up on it – the idea doesn’t work. Snapchat would be better putting their time into improving the application – they won’t stop people from screenshotting snapchats (without alerting the other person), if someone actually wants to – next thing, someone will just hook into the kernel and dump the framebuffer output.

              " 'The Navy has charged an active-duty maritime reconnaissance officer with passing U.S. military secrets to a foreign government, service officials told USNI News.\\n\\nOn Friday, the service outlined several charges – espionage being the most serious — against an unidentified lieutenant commander during an Article 32 hearing in Norfolk.\\n\\nTypically, as part of the military Article 32 charging process, an accused service member is identified in court-martial documents. But the service is not releasing the information in this instance because “this has been designated a ‘National Security Case’,” a Navy official told USNI News on Friday.\\n\\n“A ‘National Security Case ’ is one which: to any serious degree, involves the compromise of a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or terrorist group; involves an allegation of willful compromise of classified information, affects our military or defense capability to successfully resist hostile or destructive action, overt or covert; or involves an act of terrorism,” according to a manual of trying classified military cases.\\n\\nThe cases are tried under an additional set of rules than normal courts-martial due to the sensitivity of the evidence involved in the proceedings.\\n\\nWhen contacted by USNI News, U.S. Fleet Forces spokesman Capt. Jack Hanzlik did neither release the name of the officer nor any other details of the case.\\n\\nAnother Navy official told USNI News, “NCIS and FBI are still investigating the details of this case and therefore we cannot provide any additional details at this time.”\\n\\nThough heavily redacted — without dates or locations — the charging document spins a narrative in which the accused allegedly transported secret information out of the country without permission and then lied about his whereabouts when he returned to duty. The charging documents allege the O-4 successfully committed espionage twice and attempted espionage on three other occasions.\\n\\nService officials also did not specify the country to which to which the officer passed along the secrets or to which he traveled.\\n\\n“I could not tell you out of respect for the ongoing investigation,” the official said.\\n\\nIn addition to the accusations related to transmitting secrets to a foreign power, the officer was also accused of violating military law by patronizing prostitutes and committing adultery.\\n\\nThe lieutenant commander is currently in pre-trial confinement at the Naval Consolidated Brig Chesapeake, Va. and is currently assigned to commander, Patrol and Reconnaissance Group, according to the service.\\n\\nMaritime surveillance is an increasingly important national naval asset as potential U.S. adversaries like Russia and China have grown in military strength and sophistication.\\n\\nIn the last several years the U.S. has introduced several new aerial surveillance platforms, notably the Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft and the unmanned Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton long-range surveillance aircraft. Both aircraft are key to the U.S. military rebalance to the Western Pacific.\\n\\nThe last major incident of espionage by an active duty member of the Navy was the case of John Walker – a Navy warrant officer and submariner who for 18 years passed reams of military secrets to the Soviet Union before he was finally caught in 1985.',\n",

She was a 15-year-old. And when the Houston Post received the photo in December 1959, Barrett was a student in San Antonio.\\n\\n\"I was a rather unusual high school student because I was singing in night clubs,\" Barrett told me recently.\\n\\nBack then, that meant going to private clubs. In the days when one couldn\\'t buy a mixed drink in a public establishment, club memberships allowed patrons to keep a bottle at the club and imbibe whenever.\\n\\nBack to Gallery 1959 photo provides a glimpse into a rich life 2 1 of 2 Photo: Houston Chronicle files 2 of 2 Photo: Contributed photo\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was in those smoke-filled supper clubs and night clubs of San Antonio and the Southwest where Barrett entertained. During her high school days, a parent accompanied her. After high school, she traveled on her own for two-week engagements to places like Dallas, Kansas City, Mo., and Las Vegas.\\n\\n\"I did standards, blues, little bit of jazz. Pretty conventional things,\" Barrett said. Think Julie London or Peggy Lee.\\n\\nThe 5-by-8 photo was taken by her father, an Air Force pilot, in the family living room in Okinawa. A projector screen served as the backdrop. Someone wrote her name on the back of the photo along with her job title: \"nite club singer.\"\\n\\nThe photo is one of thousands over the decades that have ended up at the Post and Houston Chronicle. Some are by staff photographers and some, like this one, are handouts, meant to promote a cause, an event or an entertainer. Sometimes the photos would appear in the newspaper, sometimes not. Often, the photo would be filed away and forgotten.\\n\\nBarrett suspects the photo ended up at the Post to promote a 45 rpm single she recorded in San Antonio.\\n\\nNow a grandmother, Barrett is still onstage entertaining audiences. She\\'s managing director of The Collective Face Theater Ensemble, a nonprofit repertory theater company in Savannah, Ga.\\n\\nIn the decades leading up to her life today, she studied political science, business, worked for Texas Sen. Ralph Yarborough in Washington, D.C., and later worked in the corporate field for Clorox, Pitney Bowes and CarMax.\\n\\n\"I had a split personality,\" Barrett said, reflecting on what she wanted be when she was younger. \"I wanted either to be in show business or I wanted to be in government, which seems incongruous I know. And that is precisely what my life has done over the years.\"\\n\\nShe has always pushed boundaries. She was rebuffed from applying to two colleges - including the U.S. Air Force Academy - because of her gender.\\n\\nListen as Dandy Barrett talks about recording a 45 rpm single in San Antonio. In the second clip, she discusses the challenge ofgetting into the college of her choice as a woman in the 1960s.\\n\\nThere\\'s also been tragedy. That came in 1994 when her father escorted an abortion doctor to a clinic in Pensacola. Both were gunned down as the two entered the parking lot.\\n\\nJames H. Barrett nurtured her interest in entertainment. He had a tenor voice. He performed in operettas in high school and college. And though he made a career out of the Air Force -- flying in World War II, Korea and Vietnam -- he never stopped singing.\\n\\n\"I learned to sing with him when I was a tiny tyke,\" she said, recalling how the two would sing in the car when traveling from one duty station to another.\\n\\nLike her father, she hasn\\'t stopped singing. She still does it from time to time with The Collective Face.\\n\\nDuring our lengthy conversation, I asked her how she was able to pursue stage work while working in the boardrooms of the business world.\\n\\n\"It is easy to become singly focused and let that job become all-encompassing so that you don\\'t have time for anything else,\" she said. \"What\\'s going to hold you in good stead as you move through your life is that you have a passion for one thing or two things or three things. And never let that passion go. Never.\"',\n",

Their inspiration for Chinatown Pretty? Man Ta, \"the woman with the jade shoes,\" who Valerie first spotted getting off a bus somewhere between Chinatown and North Beach. She just knew she had to find out the story behind the chic octogenarian and her bright green kicks.As it turns out, the sneakers are from a store on Stockton Street, and she owns ten pairs: \"I wear them until they break,\" Man Ta told Valerie and Andria. A longtime Chinatown resident, she has since seen that store on Stockton shutter.Andria says, \"We love the unexpected styles we see in Chinatown. Outfits are often effortless and gutsy at the same time, they look really fresh!\"To find their street-style subjects, Andria and Valerie meet in Portsmouth Square in San Francisco Chinatown. \"There you\\'ll find seniors playing cards and chess out of makeshift tables made out of cardboard and milk crates,\" says Valerie. \"We walk around Chinatown, circling blocks for hours in hopes in running into someone whose outfit makes our hearts skip a beat.\"Sometimes the Chinatown seniors they encounter are reluctant to be interviewed and have their photos snapped; Andria and Valerie call them \"unicorns: rare, magical, and elusive.\" One such woman, prone to mixing plaid and houndstooth patterns, had always waved them off when they previously approached, until the day the two sat down next to her on a bench and waited patiently for her to feel comfortable enough to open up about her story—she was an immigrant from Hong Kong, and her white painter\\'s cap, worn cocked to the side for sun protection, belonged to her late husband.Earlier this year, Andria and Valerie made a trip down to southern California to visit Los Angeles Chinatown. They met the Wongs near the Alpine Rec Center, where Mrs. Wong teaches Luk Tung Kuen, a stretching exercise that originated in Hong Kong. The Wongs wore a matching set of canary yellow tracksuits—Mr. Wong, who suffered a stroke a few years ago, accessorized with a navy blue \"staff\" baseball cap. The Wongs were introduced by a cousin and have been married for 69 years, Andria and Valerie discovered.Timeless fashion is a common thread among the stylish seniors whose portraits and stories that Andria and Valerie have captured; the Wongs, for example, have happily worn these sunny tracksuits for decades.\"We find out the style choices are often rooted in function and cultural values,\" says Andria. \"We learn about their personal histories through their clothing.\"Valerie says, \"I\\'ve been surprised by how fiercely independent the seniors are. Many elderly people live on their own in single room occupancy apartments (SROS) with shared bathrooms and kitchens. They tell us that they prefer to live on their own; to be in an urban setting where they can easily walk or take the bus to grocery stores and doctors appointments and be in the company of friends.\"The beautiful portraits and accompanying stories featured on Chinatown Pretty lovingly honor a population that\\'s perhaps too often overlooked.

              " 'You thought Trump’s budget proposal was bad for OSHA? Well, our Republican friends in the House of Representatives have issued a bill that’s even worse, although we don’t have all of the details yet.\\n\\nThe subcommittee’s mark-up session doesn’t start until 4:30 this afternoon, and we still may not know the details until the full committee acts, possibly next week.\\n\\nThis is what we know (and read down for a rare bid of goodish news):\\n\\nOSHA: Trump proposed an OSHA budget of $543,257,000. The Republican bill provides OSHA with only $531,470,000 — almost $12 million less than Trump requested and $21 million, or 4% less than the current budget. We don’t have all of the details yet, but we do know that they are essentially flat funding the state plans, and we know that they are eliminating the Susan Harwood Worker Training Grants. (We know this because Harwood funding has previously been stipulated in the bill language. It’s not there any more.)\\n\\nMore significant cuts will mean even fewer OSHA inspectors — which mean fewer inspections and more workers who will get hurt, get sick and die in the workplace.\\n\\nSo by process of elimination, we know that if they’re putting the same $100,800,000 million into state plans, and they’re clearly going to increase compliance assistance, that leaves only enforcement and standards that they can plunder to make up the difference. OSHA was already looking at a 10% cut in enforcement staff from 2016 just based on a flat budget. Obviously, more significant cuts will mean even fewer OSHA inspectors — which mean fewer inspections and more workers who will get hurt, get sick and die in the workplace. (The AFL-CIO already estimates that it would take OSHA 159 years to inspect every workplace in the country and that promises to get much worse.)\\n\\nMSHA: MSHA is facing a $14 million cut ($15.2 million below Trump’s request) which, according the committee press release, “reflects the declining need for MSHA inspection activities due to the lower levels of mining across the country and especially in coal production.”\\n\\nNIOSH: There is some good(ish)news here. Trump had proposed a hefty $135 million (40%) cut in NIOSH’s budget. The committee bill restores most of that, only cutting $10 million (3%) from NIOSH’s budget. (It’s a sad day when a $10 million cut can be labeled “good news.”)\\n\\nDOL: In other Labor news, the bill also contains a rider prohibiting DOL from enforcing its Fiduciary Rule, requires financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients in retirement accounts. The rule had come partially into effect, although Acosta launched the regulatory process to weaken the rule, while promising to enforce the parts in effect. Passage of this rider would mean that the Department would not be able to even enforce the part of the rule that is in effect.\\n\\nJob Corps is also being cut $16 million over the 2017 enacted level, but $239.7 million above Trump’s budget request.\\n\\nThe full committee is expected to meet soon, and it’s possible there will be more poison-pill riders there. Stay tuned, and keep calling.',\n",

Sure, Trump acts like he\\'s in charge, but that\\'s because he\\'s too dumb to realize that Bannon is so obviously pulling the strings that he\\'s become a joke. A real, impressive winner (not a Fake! Sad! Loser! like Trump) would recognize he\\'s being manipulated by a power-hungry jackass who is actively trying to destroy the founding principles of this nation. And what\\'s truly crazy is that that statement isn\\'t even slightly hyperbolic.\\n\\nTrump\\'s America Politics News & Culture Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s Closest Adviser, Just Wants to See the World Burn A tale of two terrifying quotes.\\n\\nSteve Bannon is making far-reaching and unprecedented decisions in this White House and is undermining the basic checks and balances that you learned about in junior-high civics class. For example, he was the architect of Donald Trump\\'s horrific \"Don\\'t call it a Muslim ban even though I call it a Muslim ban\" Muslim ban, and when the Department of Homeland Security\\'s lawyers concluded that the ban should not include people who hold green cards, Steve Bannon apparently personally overruled them.\\n\\nAnd, as if that weren\\'t enough, in an unprecedented move, Steve Bannon has been appointed to the National Security Council even as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence were demoted. And lest you think this isn\\'t a big deal, take *The New York Times’*s word for it:\\n\\n...who sits at the National Security Council table when the administration debates issues of war and peace can make a real difference in decisions. In giving Mr. Bannon an official role in national security policy making, Mr. Trump has not simply broken with tradition but has embraced the risk of politicizing national security, or giving the impression of doing so.\\n\\nSo now, a man who is a political animal and an amoral opportunist, who years ago said that his goal is to \"destroy the state\" and \"bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment,” is now going to be an even bigger voice in shaping U.S. foreign policy. And lest you think he\\'s changed his mind since then, here\\'s what he said YESTERDAY to The Washington Post about attorney general nominee and noted racist Jeff Sessions.\\n\\n“Throughout the campaign, Sessions has been the fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump’s agenda, and has played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy to undergird the implementation of that agenda. What we are witnessing now is the birth of a new political order, and the more frantic a handful of media elites become, the more powerful that new political order becomes itself.”\\n\\nHe\\'s casually throwing around phrases like \"new political order\" as if they aren\\'t terrifying when paired with him running roughshod over the rights of...well, everyone who isn\\'t a rich, white, straight male. And if you still think Trump is actually in control, here\\'s what Bannon said of his so-called boss last year:\\n\\n\"[Donald Trump is a] blunt instrument for us,” he told me earlier this summer. “I don’t know whether he really gets it or not.”\\n\\nSo there you have it. A man who wants to \"destroy the state\" and who basically bragged that he was manipulating Trump to his own ends has already, in only eleven days, risen to an unprecedented level of influence for someone in his position. He\\'s already overruled entire departments of government and unseated qualified security experts on the NSC. So we should get some slimy photos of Steve Bannon ready for those junior-high civics classrooms. After all, they usually have photos of the presidents on their walls.\\n\\nAn Apology:',\n",

My original guess was that it was going to pander to console players by making it slower ( I thought this after I saw the scroll wheel that slowed down game play.) It has been a long while since I have seen a shooter with intelligent map design, design which rewards players for playing the game at a faster pace, in fact I rarely found myself stopping in between combat, if at all.

But OpenSSL\\'s portability approach had become one of extreme overkill, with the code incorporating numerous hacks and workarounds to make it run on such outdated platforms as VMS, OS/2, NetWare, 16-bit Windows, and even DOS.\\n\\nBy comparison, LibreSSL is focusing on Unix-like operating systems for now, although a Windows port may appear in the future.\\n\\nIn a presentation given in May, LibreSSL developer Bob Beck explained that much of the initial work on LibreSSL involved deleting code that only existed to provide support for oddball systems. Between that effort and removing redundant and unused code, the LibreSSL group was able to shrink the size of the OpenSSL codebase by about 23 per cent.\\n\\nThe LibreSSL developers have also worked to get OpenSSL\\'s unorthodox and inconsistent source code into \"kernel normal form\" (KNF), a standard C coding style used by the OpenBSD project.\\n\\nIn addition, although the goal of the LibreSSL project is to create a secure, drop-in replacement for OpenSSL, the developers have also tried to undo some of the OpenSSL developers\\' more ill-advised design decisions.\\n\\nFor example, the OpenSSL library relies on a quirky custom memory-management layer that behaves in strange ways, which makes it impossible to audit the code with tools designed to flag memory management problems.

I ripped off the blankets to check for any unwanted thing animal or not animal, but it seemed clean enough. checked on ever door for anything unwanted, since I was already frightened! everything seemed to be OK. so i just turned off the light and tried to have a sleep. I heard lots of noise, people fighting, children crying, loud music, Luckily no one knocked. the shower was not that that bad. Im not that special for hotels. Ive been to a bunch of hotels even in so rustic places, but this one definitely freaked me out. I tought someone was coming in to steal or kill me. and as I read other comments I really think we were lucky. My friend wasnt that freaked, until today we read the comments. I told him on sunday morning i just read about an killed guy on a motels parcking.

              " 'Not Sparkles The Clown AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd There are some disturbing aspects to a police tactic known as civil forfeiture, which lets cops make money from seizing cash and property from alleged criminals, as detailed in story by Robert O\\'Harrow Jr. and Steven Rich at the Washington Post.\\n\\nThe Justice Department\\'s Equitable Sharing Program allows local police departments to keep 80% of the stuff seized during drug raids and other investigations. While it sounds unbelievable, police can seize your assets even if you\\'re never convicted of a crime as long as cops believe you obtained the property illegally.\\n\\nYou can go to court to get it back, but that\\'s a long and expensive process that\\'s just not realistic for a lot of people.\\n\\nMeanwhile, police departments can use the money to boost their budgets. The article in the Post suggests that much of this money doesn\\'t go to practical crime-fighting gear. In some departments civil forfeiture cash has paid for military-grade equipment that might be more suitable for a war zone than a US city or town.\\n\\nThe military gear includes an armored personnel carrier costing $227,000 in Douglasville, Ga. as well as a $1 million mobile command bus in Prince George\\'s County, Maryland and a $5 million helicopter for Los Angeles cops.\\n\\nThen there the more frivolous things civil forfeiture cash buys, like a $637 coffee maker for cops in Amarillo, Texas and $5,300 worth of \"challenge coin\" medallions in Brunswick County, North Carolina.\\n\\nPerhaps the oddest purchase was $225 spent on a clown in Reminderville, Ohio meant to improve relations between the community and police. Here\\'s how Chief Jeff Buck defended that purchase to the Post: \"The money I spent on Sparkles the Clown is a very, very minute portion of the forfeited money that I spend in fighting the war on drugs.\"\\n\\nThis isn\\'t just a matter of police being fiscally irresponsible. They\\'re being irresponsible with cash that may very well have been seized from innocent people.\\n\\nThe Washington Post examined 43,000 reports on asset seizures dating back to 2008, which reported $2.5 billion in spending from these seizures. According to the Post\\'s analysis, 81% of that spending came from seizures in which the property or cash owners were never indicted.',\n",

Tanner, Young Women General President, present two powerful messages on self-image and society's obsession with outward appearance. Based on their October 2005 General Conference addresses, this small-size volume explores the intimate link between body, mind, and spirit. Women of all ages are confronted with fixation on the physical body. This has become increasingly common in the world today. Elder Holland asserts, “You are bombarded in movies, television, fashion magazines, and advertisements with the message that looks are everything! The pitch is, 'If your looks are good enough, your life will be glamorous and you will be happy and popular.' That kind of pressure is immense in the teenage years to say nothing of later womanhood.” These timely and inspired messages will help us to understand that happiness comes from accepting and enhancing our natural attributes, not from remaking our bodies after the image of the world.\",\n",

The federal agency spent $1,050,000 chopping down marijuana plants in FY2014 and $950,000 the next year. But for the current fiscal year, only $760,000 is allocated in the budget.\\n\\nIn Oregon, where voters approved legalization in November 2014 and legal sales began about a year later, DEA anti-marijuana spending is down from $1,000,000 in FY2014 to just $200,000 in FY2016. DEA allocated nothing for marijuana eradication for any of the past three fiscal years in Alaska, which also voted to legalize in 2014.\\n\\nWhile the state reductions can’t be directly attributed to the end of cannabis prohibition — some non-legal states have dipped too, while others have increased — the data undermines a common talking point from opponents of legalization who argue that the new laws actually make it easier for drug cartels and gangs to set up shop and undercut the regulated and taxed legal market.\\n\\nIf that were true, one would expect to see federal agencies putting even more emphasis into those states. But the new data shows that in every state that has so far implemented a legal market for marijuana, DEA spending on cannabis eradication is down.\\n\\nThis year, voters in Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada will get a chance to legalize marijuana via questions on their November ballots.\\n\\nPhoto Courtesy of Allie Beckett.',\n",

AFP PHOTO / MIGUEL SCHINCARIOL (Photo credit should read Miguel Schincariol/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nIn 2000, The New York Times labeled the dotcom bubble as a \"euphoric\" time characterized by the period\\'s extreme highs and subsequent crashing lows. The short-lived hyper success of the internet startup age did not die in vain; the phenomenon fundamentally changed technological innovation, business models, investment mentalities and the global financial markets. Now in our post-recessionary age, experts are predicting that similar to internet startups, cannabis will be the next industry to rock the business, financial and investment worlds.\\n\\nMore than 14 million Americans consume marijuana on a regular basis. Legal marijuana sales totaled $2.3 billion in 2014 alone whereas the illegal marijuana market is said to produce more than $18 billion in revenue per year. If we momentarily put aside the legal controversy, the numbers alone reveal that regulated cannabis is a major potential market that remains largely untapped. Despite the federal ban against the drug, there are currently more than 23 states and U.S. territories which have implemented some form of medical or recreational marijuana decriminalization. As more states pass marijuana legal reform, an increasing number of entrepreneurs and investors view the \"Green Rush\" as a major business opportunity with the potential to transform the pharmaceutical, food & beverage and commercial industries.\\n\\nSome investors are wary of betting their chances on a product that the federal government still labels as a Schedule 1 substance. The disparate federal and state laws create an environment of uncertainty that make many investors rightfully nervous. Another concern lies in the recent high volatility of certain publicly traded marijuana stock which can be a reminder of the rollercoaster days we saw back in the dotcom heyday. Additionally, instances where cannabis companies released misleading or even falsified information about its employees and/or products has made it harder for investors to differentiate between legitimate operations with clean track records and shady businesses seeking to manipulate investors.',\n",

It seems to be that they’re doing it for their own personal gain, which is fine, but I think that we could look at the Olympics as a positive that Boston was chosen. There was no money spent. We got out of the bid. I wasn’t going to sign that agreement.”\\n\\nWhile there was never any one line item for Boston 2024 in the budget, city resources and manpower were dedicated to the proposal. And time is money—that’s more or less the reason that City Hall gave when it charged activist Jonathan Cohn more than $1,000 for City Hall’s emails with Boston 2024 organizers. (Never mind that the Brattle Report, detailing what happened with the bid, cost state taxpayers as much as $250,000.)\\n\\nAnd then there’s that pesky “agreement.” In an October 2014 letter to the United States Olympic Committee, as well as the legally binding joinder agreement signed in February 2015—revised after the previous version included a gag order forbidding city employees from speaking ill of the bid—Walsh committed to signing the Host City Contract “unedited,” and that the City of Boston “will agree to the terms, without reservation.” That contract included the taxpayer guarantee.\\n\\nWalsh’s crusade against the book continued in an interview with WGBH’s Jim Braude Tuesday night: “They immediately took a position against the Olympics without having a conversation with me or anyone on the Olympic side to see what it meant.” But Boston 2024 chairman John Fish agreed to meet with No Boston Olympics in 2014, only to cancel the night before and never reschedule. Though Walsh promised in November 2014 to hold public meetings on the bid before the year’s end, this did not happen, either.\\n\\n“It is disappointing to be called an ‘opportunist’ for chronicling the story of how regular Bostonians successfully opposed an ill-conceived Olympic bid that would have set back our region and stuck taxpayers with a multibillion dollar bill,” says Dempsey, now the executive director of Transportation for Massachusetts. “Professor Zimbalist and I wrote the book because we felt there were lessons in Boston 2024 for leaders in cities worldwide.

              " \"What does my 14,000-person rural town in upstate New York have in common with Los Angeles, one of the country’s largest metropolitan areas?\\n\\nWe’re both standing up to the oil and gas industry. And we’re winning.\\n\\nIn 2011, our local town board voted to ban fracking within our town borders—one of the first towns in New York to do so:\\n\\nThis month, Los Angeles leaders took a similarly courageous stand, passing a moratorium that would prohibit fracking within city limits unless studies show the practice would not harm the health of their community or their water supply.\\n\\nIn doing so, Los Angeles joined a coast-to-coast groundswell aimed at protecting people from the consequences of the fracking-enabled oil and gas rush. Last week, Santa Barbara residents announced they’re kicking off a petition drive for a fracking ban initiative.\\n\\nCommunities all over the U.S. have good reason to be concerned: Fracking, a process used to extract oil and gas from shale rock formations, has been associated with poisoned water, air pollution, and serious health problems, not to mention animal deaths and industrial disasters and explosions. Some of the hazardous substances associated with the practice include: cancer-causing benzene and deadly hydrogen sulfide. Many more of the hundreds of chemicals used in the fracking process are never revealed to the public even if there is an accident.\\n\\nIn spite of the risks, fracking has been deregulated to an alarming degree. The oil and gas industry has gained exemptions from critical portions of key federal laws designed to protect public health and the environment, including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To Know Act. And in California, the state legislature passed and Gov. Gerry Brown signed a weak bill allowing fracking to proceed without a full environmental assessment of the safety, health and environmental risks.\\n\\nWith the state and federal governments failing to protect the public, local communities are a critical line of defense. Luckily, California communities have the power to use local zoning laws to protect themselves. That’s what we did in Dryden. And that’s what Los Angeles has done.\\n\\nOur town of 14,000 stands in proud solidarity with the people of Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. We may be small—but we’re not alone. The elected officials in our little town alone have received more than 30,000 letters of support from people all around the country and world, cheering us on for taking a stand.\\n\\nThe oil and gas industry often threatens to sue communities that take on fracking. In our case, they actually did. But we’ve beaten them at every turn, winning two rounds against them in New York state courts. This spring, our case will be heard by New York’s highest court. And, with the help of our pro-bono attorneys at Earthjustice, we’re confident that we’ll prevail.\\n\\nAnschutz Exploration Corporation, owned by billionaire Philip Anschutz (who also owns L.A.'s Staples Center), was the first company to sue us. After losing in the first court battle, Anshutz pulled out. Norse Energy stepped in and appealed the case; they have since gone bankrupt.\\n\\nLast week, I joined a delegation of people from fracking impacted and threatened communities to travel up and down the state of California, educating people about the dangers of fracking and more importantly: what people can do about it.\\n\\nThe nationwide tour, sponsored by Stop the Frack Attack—a 136-group coalition—is traveling to states where the oil and gas industry is poised to begin major activity using this dangerous and controversial technique.\\n\\nWe traveled to Sacramento, Merced and Los Angeles this month. We’ve learned that more and more communities have been stepping up. But there’s lots more work to be done. Get involved.\\n\\nAn earlier version of this blog appeared in the Huffington Post.\",\n",

              " 'While the community continues to piece together the confusing, disheartening mess surrounding 3rd Ward’s closure (Hyperallergic has a pretty comprehensive look at what actually happened), local artists and organizations—many of whom are still owed money by the shuttered organization—have done an impressive job of coming together, with institutions like Brooklyn Brainery, Course Horse, and even Manhattan’s National Academy School stepping up to offer classes and services to displaced former members. Local writer and teacher Robin Grearson is now doing one better, having wrangled more than twenty small businesses, as well as teachers and artists, for “What’s Next? Creating Community,” designed as a post-3rd Ward means of bringing Brooklyn’s creative community together.\\n\\n“The collapse was so sudden and final that it didn’t allow anyone to come up with solutions as a community,” says Grearson, a former freelance instructor at 3rd Ward (“I’m not one of the people they owe money to,” she notes). “The people I met through 3rd Ward are all really creative, talented people. If anyone can build something from nothing on a moment’s notice, it’s this group. I just wanted them to find a place to be able to start talking to each other. ”\\n\\nThe event quickly found a home at Brooklyn Brewery (which donated its tasting room and use of its staff for the night), and will essentially serve as a means of connecting 3rd Ward’s former denizens with like-minded local institutions like Brooklyn Fire Proof, Mellow Pages, Silent Barn, and Union Docs. “Former instructors will be talking about new projects and plans, small businesses will be introduced who serve tech, fashion, and culinary communities,” Grearson says. “Speakers will talk about free stuff they’re offering displaced students, and classrooms will be connecting with instructors–all free, all for individuals to find their own ways to build/make/design/learn.”\\n\\nAll of which sounds like a pretty solid way to spend a night, even if it’s coming as the result of a dubiously run business leaving trusting local artists in the lurch. Grearson also notes, “People feel the loss of 3rd Ward because it attracted so many talented, smart, and creative people. But the people were its strength, and they’re still here. I want to see value return to the creative community instead of a group investors.” Doesn’t seem like a bad idea to us.\\n\\nFollow Virginia K. Smith on Twitter @vksmith.',\n",

              " 'CRS warns about uselessness of FBI-employed food-purchase surveillance Nick Juliano\\n\\nPublished: Wednesday January 2, 2008\\n\\n\\n\\ndel.icio.us |\\n\\nPrint This Email This In separate report, UK-based privacy watchdog says US \\'endemic surveillance\\' is among world\\'s worst Congressional researchers warned last month that attempts to identify potential terrorists based on food purchases could easily be based on inaccurate information and waste government time and resources. It\\'s unclear if reports that the FBI had been doing precisely that led to the Congressional Research Service admonition. But a 41-page CRS report outlines several ways in which data mining falls short as a terror-preventing tactic. The data-mining mismanagement identified by CRS serves as one of myriad reasons a UK-based privacy watchdog has ranked the United States alongside China, Russia and Singapore among the top surveillance societies on the globe. In its report, CRS warned that the government was pushing forward with data-mining efforts ostensibly to prosecute the War on Terror, despite concerns about inaccurate and incomplete information that could \"make data mining an ill-suited tool\" for predicting terrorist activity. In the case of shopper\\'s club cards, data that grocery stores use to target coupons and advertisements at customers might be useless when applied to national security investigations because of recordkeeping errors, inaccurate information or duplicate records, CRS warns. If a government agency were to use that information to target individuals based on food purchases associated with particular religious observances though, an outcome based on inaccurate information could be, at the least, a waste of resources by the government agency, and an unpleasant experience for the misidentified individual. However, according to Jeff Stein in Congressional Quarterly, the FBI \"sifted through\" grocery store data around San Francisco in 2005 and 2006. \"The idea,\" Stein writes, \"was that a spike in, say, falafel sales, combined with other data, would lead to Iranian secret agents in the south San Francisco-San Jose area.\" The FBI, for its part, issued a vague non-denial denial pronouncing the story \"too ridiculous to be true.\" Effort wasted examining grocery store receipts was not the only problem identified by CRS in its survey of government data-mining efforts, including the \"Total Information Awareness\" program (which was later renamed the \"Terrorism Information Awareness\" program in an \"Orwellian\" twist to placate critics). Such routine access to privately collected data on Americans, not to mention the NSA\\'s warrantless wiretapping program and Congress\\'s attempts to scuttle oversight of possible abuses as it rewrites the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, has the US listed as an \"endemic surveillance society\" in Privacy International\\'s latest survey. As Kim Zetter notes at Wired\\'s Threat Level blog: In terms of statutory protections and privacy enforcement, the US is the worst ranking country in the democratic world. In terms of overall privacy protection the United States has performed very poorly, being out-ranked by both India and the Philippines and falling into the \"black\" category, denoting endemic surveillance.

We reported on their VW e-Golf with a 55 kWh battery pack and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s custom all-electric Mercedes G-Class made by Kreisel.\\n\\nNow the company unveils their latest project: a classic Porsche 910 converted to all-electric with a custom powertrain.\\n\\nFor its previous projects, Kreisel has been trying to get the attention of OEMs and show them that they can make better versions of their vehicles. This project is different since they are actually selling the car.\\n\\nIt’s not cheap: one million Euros ($1,065,000 USD).\\n\\nWhile it’s clearly not for everyone, you can actually get a lot of out it. Of course, you get an all-electric version of a classic Porsche 910. Only 35 units were originally produced and later 4 were rebuilt by EVEX, this is one of them.\\n\\nThe all-electric performance of the car is also impressive thanks to the high-energy density 53 kWh battery pack that they managed to fit in a 1,100 kg (2,400 lbs) car:\\n\\n“The high-performance (lithium-ion) battery pack, with a capacity of 53 kilowatt-hours, which is installed in the Kreisel EVEX 910e, weights 1.100 kilograms and enables a realistic range of 350 kilometres (217 miles). To accommodate the battery system as well as the powertrain in the rear, the frame of the original vehicle was slightly modified. Besides that the air-cooling of the historical vehicle was replaced by a cooling system which Kreisel developed for the high-performance drive.”\\n\\nThose are decent specs and with a 0-100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) time of 2.5 seconds, the vehicle is competitive on the dragstrip with the Tesla Model S P100D Ludicrous.

Toby Oliver lenses the film, keeping Rothe in almost every frame. While this tactic was nerve wracking in mother!, here it is yet another dollop of camp that only enriches the film\\'s slim running time.

The company is said to be looking to bag a discount on the streaming revenue cut charged by labels, now that Apple Music and iTunes both bring enough traction for music companies. Apple is reportedly looking to cut the profit revenue percentage of record labels from streaming, as their deals now expire by the end of June, and new deals need to be signed.\\n\\nBloomberg reports that Apple looks to bring its rate down to what competitor Spotify pays to its labels. In the initial days of Apple Music, the company reportedly overpaid record labels to get them on board. The music industry was vary that Apple Music would cannibalise their iTunes business – which was a major source of revenue. However, now that Apple Music has been live for two years, and hasn’t been as harmful to iTunes as expected, record labels are now warming up to the idea, albeit with reservations, the report adds.\\n\\nThe report also claims that record labels are still asking Apple to push iTunes in countries where streaming isn’t such a big deal. In countries like Japan and Germany, music is still bought and heard, rather than streamed. In developing and emerging countries, people still prefer to download than stream music.\\n\\nIn the current deal, Apple gave 58 percent of revenue generated from Apple Music subscribers to record labels, while Spotify has now reduced that margin to just 52 percent. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report states, “The labels are open to a reduction in Apple’s rate -- provided it’s also able to expand subscriber rolls and meet other requirements.”\\n\\nSpotify was able to bargain as it promised a growth in subscribers, and Apple may be using similar tactics to get music labels on board with the negotiations, the report adds.',\n",

Kimmel developed a friendship with Rickles over the years, and spoke through tears to share his memories of “Mr. Warmth.”\\n\\nHe recounted times Rickles ribbed him, read notes he sent, and described how he would “make fun of John Stamos for three hours straight without a breath.” There’s also a story about Rickles’ famous relationship Frank Sinatra that comes—not via Rickles directly—but from Bob Newhart.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“He gave me advice—and good advice, not the advice people give you just to hear themselves giving you advice,” Kimmel said. “He would always say, ‘Keep my name alive.’ He’d tell me to keep his name alive, which I thought was funny because, you know, I was like, ’You’re Don Rickles, you keep my name alive.’ He was humble.

              " 'The Kel-Tec RFB (Rifle, Forward-ejection, Bullpup)[4] is a gas-operated bullpup type semi-automatic rifle, manufactured by Kel-Tec Industries of Florida. At the 2008 SHOT Show held from February 2 to 5 in Las Vegas, Nevada it was declared by Kel-Tec representatives that the RFB rifle would be made available to the public by the 4th quarter of 2008. Later, the Kel-Tec website stated that the 18 in (460 mm) barrel carbine variant would not be shipping until February 2009 due to a change in the production process intended as preventative measures against potential gun control legislation.[5] The rifle first shipped to distributors in the first week of March 2009 and was first seen at the 2007 SHOT Show.[1]\\n\\nDesign details [ edit ]\\n\\nThe RFB is a semi-automatic firearm chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester ammunition. The RFB uses metric FAL magazines,[6] which insert straight into the magazine well and do not need to rock into place. It has a short-stroke gas piston operating system.[7] The rifle uses a patented forward-ejection system via a tube placed over the barrel that ejects the spent case forwards, over the handguard of the rifle. Extraction is accomplished by two extractors, each with two axes of rotation. The extractors may move side-to-side to engage the rim of the case, and pivot upwards to extract the spent case after firing. Empty cases remain in the ejection chute[3] until either the weapon is tilted downwards, the charging handle is operated, or they are pushed out by following cases. Cases drop gently from this chute to the left of the barrel.[1] To avoid sloppy trigger pull typical of firearms modified into bullpups, the RFB uses a floating linkage bar between the sear and the hammer, allowing the sear to remain above the trigger.[8] The weapon is fully ambidextrous,[9] much in the style of the Belgian F2000 rifle. The RFB is delivered without iron sights.[10] A mil-spec Picatinny rail is provided for mounting a wide range of optics and tactical accessories.[8]\\n\\nThe barrel of the RFB is not fully free floated, it instead serves as the rigid \"spine\" of the weapon, to which all other components are attached (either directly or through other components).\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kel-Tec has introduced similar bullpup rifles in 5.56mm called the RDB and the M43, released in 2014.[11]\\n\\nVariants [ edit ]\\n\\nKel-Tec has produced at least four versions with differing barrel lengths, weight, overall length, and performance:\\n\\nCarbine with an 18 in (460 mm) barrel,\\n\\nwith an 18 in (460 mm) barrel, Sporter variant with 24 in (610 mm) length barrel,\\n\\nvariant with 24 in (610 mm) length barrel, Target version with either a heavy profile 32 in (810 mm) barrel or 26 in (660 mm) stainless steel barrel, and\\n\\nversion with either a heavy profile 32 in (810 mm) barrel or 26 in (660 mm) stainless steel barrel, and RFB-C with an 18.5 in (470 mm) barrel meeting the Canadian requirement for non-restricted rifles, exclusively for export to Canada.[12]\\n\\nThe Target version also features a five-way adjustable trigger, for a trigger pull from 2 to 6 lb f (8.9 to 26.7 N). As of 2013, all four variants have been publicly released for sale.[citation needed]\\n\\nSee also [ edit ]\\n\\nReferences [ edit ]',\n",

Their albums are made from vivid pulps, gaudy streaks, and soupy palettes from which melodies and hooks emerge with euphoric clarity. They are a band that make pop music, only, you’ve got to find it first.\\n\\nOn their forthcoming album Painting With (to be released in February via Domino) the spectrum is conjured again – crystalline melodies appear fully formed from the psychedelic melee. Far from faded, the brushstrokes feel brighter and bolder than before. I find myself obsessing over this dynamic before I speak to Dave Portner (Avey Tare), one of the band’s vocalists, founding members and multi-instrumentalists.\\n\\n“The way I got into it was making flyers for shows—somehow it fell on me to do the flyers when we first starting playing,” Portner says, responding generously to a question as simple as ‘do you paint?’ “I started pretty simply at first,” he explains. “I’d take these flyers and hang them up over New York, just as a way to do something organic and visually different, then that carried into doing some of the album artwork.

              " 'Science can’t yet tell us whether they have more fun – but it has uncovered a new genetic change that makes people blonde. And contrary to long held belief, it seems golden hair hasn’t simply been introduced across the globe by travelling tow heads, but instead evolved separately in different human populations.\\n\\nIndigenous people of the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific have some of the darkest skin pigmentation outside of Africa. But unlike most other tropical populations, they also have a high prevalence of blonde hair. Up to 10 per cent of the population is fair haired, the highest proportion outside of Europe. Until now, this odd trait had generally been attributed to the introduction of blonde genes by European explorers and traders in preceding centuries. “We originally thought, well that must be a Captain Cook allele,” says Carlos Bustamante at Stanford University.\\n\\nYet a closer look revealed that the genetics behind blonde hair in Brussels are distinct from those leading to flaxen locks in the South Pacific.\\n\\nBustamante, Sean Myles and colleagues at Stanford discovered this after analysing saliva samples from 43 blondes and 42 dark-haired Solomon Islanders. A genome-wide scan pointed to a single strong difference between the groups at a gene called TYRP1. Further analysis revealed that a single-letter change in the gene accounted for 46 per cent of the population’s hair colour variation, with the blonde allele being recessive to the dark hair allele. The blonde mutation wasn’t found in any of the 900 other individuals sampled from outside the South Pacific (Science, DOI: 10.1126/science.1217849).\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTYRP1 is known to be involved in skin and hair pigmentation in several species. In normally black mice, for example, a mutation in the gene produces light brown coats. A rare kind of human albinism is also caused by mutations in TYRP1, which produces reddish skin colour and ginger hair. TYRP1 isn’t, however, one of the genes that produces blonde hair in Europeans. The novel blonde mutation in Solomon Islanders is likely to have cropped up around 10,000 years ago, and it appears to be the same one behind blondness in Fiji and other regions of the South Pacific.\\n\\n“Before this, everybody would have thought, blonde hair evolved once in humans,” says Bustamante. “This tells us we can’t really assume that even these common mutations are common across different human populations. Non-European populations are critical to study to find mutations that may be underlying the vast phenotypic variation of humans.”',\n",

              " 'I realize that some of you are most likely wondering, “Why is he not writing about the Baltimore situation?”\\n\\nBecause, quite frankly, I believe that is a total waste of time. Like I wrote about the local story here about the guy who got shot by the feds here, when they were trying to arrest him:\\n\\nThe man was armed with a hammer, he tried to attack a federal officer, and he got shot. Just another day in the big city. But, as you know, because he is black, as was the agent that shot him; because of the stuff happening everywhere now, the left and their media lap-dogs are going to exploit this, in hopes that there is another riot in Detroit. Because that, is what marxists do. Marxists exploit stuff like this to disrupt the system. You watch and see, summer is coming and Detroit has a white mayor. You watch, another uprising is coming and the marxists will be in the middle of it.\\n\\nDespite the fact that 3 of the officers involved in the situation in Baltimore were black, like here in Detroit where the fed agent was black, who shot the suspect — none of that matters. It is going to be portrayed as a evil white police force or in the case here in Detroit as a evil white Government killing blacks.\\n\\nIt is especially hazardous to one’s well being and livelihood, if you happen to be white and have an opinion that is not a part of the demented liberal socialist marxist politically correct stripe. Which is something Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Teana Walsh found out the hard way:\\n\\nDays after posting her opinion on how to deal with protesters and looters in Baltimore, Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Teana Walsh resigned. Walsh, 35, did not make public comments about her resignation. The resignation was sent to Prosecutor Kym Worthy Friday afternoon in response to push back for her Facebook post about shooting people in Baltimore. Her post, from April 27, read in part “So I am watching the news in Baltimore and see large swarms of people throwing bricks, etc at police who are fleeing from their assaults … 15 in the hospital already.” “Solution. Simple. Shoot em. Period. End of discussion. I don’t care what causes the protesters to turn violent…what the ‘they did it because’ reason is…no way is this acceptable. Flipping disgusting.” Walsh, who was on maternity leave, was set to be disciplined for the post. Instead she voluntarily resigned. “This afternoon Assistant Prosecutor Teana Walsh called Prosecutor Kym Worthy to announce that she is voluntarily resigning her position with the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office,” spokeswoman Maria Miller said in a release. “During her tenure in the office, Teana Walsh has been known for her great work ethic and her compassion for victims of crime and their families. Her post was up online briefly and she immediately took it down. The post was completely out of character for her and certainly does not reflect the person that we know.” Worthy called the potential discipline an “internal matter,” and didn’t say what it would have been. Activist group Progress Michigan released a statement about the incident calling into question all of Walsh’s work with the department. “Kym Worthy must conduct a thorough review of Walsh’s conduct,” Lonnie Scott, executive director for Progress Michigan said in a release. “For an assistant county prosecutor to call for the summary execution of disenfranchised and angered citizens shows she has little regard for justice or due process.” The organization claims it “holds public officials and government accountable,” in its mission statement.\\n\\nJust so everyone knows Teana Walsh looks like this:\\n\\nSo, white people cannot have an opinion, that truly is a righteous opinion about what happened in Baltimore? It sure appears that way. But then again, that is what happens when you let Marxists rule the Country.\\n\\nUpdate: Teana Walsh’s part of this story, is now a Memeorandum thread, with the usual left-wing suspects weighing in.',\n",
              " 'The science of human endurance is fascinating because it is so little understood, so variable, and because excelling at a monumental task isn’t simply a matter of physical strength. “If races were really just plumbing contests—tests of whose pipes could deliver the most oxygen and pump the most blood—they would be boringly deterministic,” writes Alex Hutchinson in Endure: Mind, Body and the Curiously Elastic Limits of Human Performance. “You race once, and you know your limits. But that’s not how it works.” After 24 hours of physical exertion, it isn’t baseline strength that matters as much as mental fortitude, and grit is equally available to both sexes. The same weekend as the Revenant ultra run featured in this issue took place, a British woman, Jasmine Paris, won a 431-kilometre mountain race along the Pennine Way between England and Scotland. (Her time of 83 hours, 12 minutes set a new course record.) Viewing the Revenant in person involved a lot of waiting on tussock-clad hillsides, but I was enthralled, fully invested in the success or failure of 21 people I’d only just met. An ultra runner requires the qualities we most admire about the New Zealand psyche—they are proto-New Zealanders. We value effort when no one’s watching. We value persistence over talent, and across extremely long distances, sheer stubbornness—call it bloody-mindedness—is what prevails. We value toughness, the kind that can’t be built in gyms or isolated by sports scientists. We value capability and self-sufficiency. In the Revenant, runners figure out a route across trackless land, face up to the elements, judge the time from the setting of the moon or the rising of the sun. They cannot receive any help. “It comes down to the ability to keep going at any pace,” says Dave Viitakangas, who is on the cover of this issue. (He completed a full loop of the course, despite an injury.) Ultra running prompts us to ask the question: how would we fare if it was only our mental strength on the line? The pursuit of that great reckoning of psychological fortitude is what draws people in increasing numbers to marathons, to long missions in the hills. “When you are by yourself and you know that you are the only one that you can rely on, I feel like that’s when you are the sharpest as a human being,” said one of the Revenant runners, United States Navy SEAL Chadd Wright, in a Trail Runner Nation podcast after the race. “When you can’t look to someone else to have that courage in a moment of weakness and you’re by yourself and you know your only option is to rely on yourself—at times you can be sharper at that point than you would be within a group.” Wright raced in a team of two, but the pair of them experienced a moment of intense isolation. Emerging after nearly 30 hours from a psychologically difficult section of the course, his teammate wondered about contacting the race organisers to let them know where they were. The realisation dawned on Wright: “No one cares where we are.” Acknowledging it was a form of liberation: returning to home base was entirely up to him, and when he finally arrived back, the achievement would be entirely his. That’s the whole purpose of the Revenant. Here, the only race takes place within. Sure, the Revenant has its critics—too long, too hard, inspires people to do dangerous things. And why create an event where you expect everyone to lose, anyway? “If you’re going to face a real challenge, it has to be a real challenge,” said Gary Cantrell, the founder of the Barkley Marathons, a difficult ultra race in Tennessee. The Barkley has become legendary, attracting documentary crews, as well as news coverage every time it’s run, even though most years, no one finishes. Cantrell started the Barkley for one reason entirely: “You can’t accomplish anything without the possibility of failure.”',\n",

Sales have reportedly tripled over the last week after Apple began offering a discount of at least 7,000 rupees for customers who trade in any smartphone in exchange for an iPhone 4.With that discount, customers can get an iPhone 4 for less than 20,000 rupees. But even at that discounted price, Apple is still well above the low-end competitors in India that are currently dominating sales.The popularity of low-priced options in markets like India, China and Brazil, where contract subsidies are not common, has helped to drive speculation that Apple could release a new iPhone model with a lower price to address those markets. Reports have suggested that Apple plans to launch a low-cost iPhone model later this year made of a plastic shell to reduce costs.However, it's unlikely that Apple would hit price points as low as Karbonn and Micromax are currently offering in India. Market watchers instead expect that Apple could offer an unsubsidized low-cost iPhone model for between $250 and $300\",\n",

              " \"President Donald Trump’s stops in Cedar Rapids Wednesday touched on many important Iowa issues, from wind power to wrestling. The Gazette’s Fact Checker will review six statements for accuracy.\\n\\nBeef exports\\n\\nFirst, in a statement about Trump from former Gov. Terry Branstad — now U.S. ambassador to China — who congratulated the president on trade relations with China.\\n\\n“We’ve been trying to get American beef in China for 13 years and you’ve already done it,” Branstad said during an earlier event at Kirkwood Community College.\\n\\nThe United States has been frozen out of China’s beef market since 2003 when a case of mad cow disease got international attention. China dropped that ban in September — two months before Trump was elected. Increased trade talks this spring have resulted in an announcement last month that beef exports will be allowed into China by mid-July, according to news outlets, including National Public Radio.\\n\\nTrump deserves credit for new developments in Chinese markets, but not for changes that happened before he was elected. Branstad’s claim is only half true.\\n\\nTrump successes\\n\\nTrump said he has passed 38 bills since he was inaugurated Jan. 20. GovTrack.us reports 40 laws have been enacted since Jan. 3. The president is correct in his claim.\\n\\nThe coal industry has gotten a boost from Trump, who issued an executive order in March rescinding parts of President Barack Obama’s clean power plan.\\n\\nTrump talked about those changes and touted “clean, beautiful coal,” telling the Cedar Rapids audience at the U.S. Cellular Center Wednesday that “30,000 mining jobs have been added since my inauguration.”\\n\\nThis claim has been checked by several news outlets, including CNN Money, which spoke with a former Trump economic adviser who said the number of new mining jobs actually was closer to 43,000. However, Labor Department statistics show half those jobs were in oil and gas — not coal — and another 6,000 were in “non-metallic mining and quarrying, digging for things like granite and marble,” CNN reported.\\n\\nOnly 1,300 of the new jobs were in coal mines, according to CNN.\\n\\nSo while Trump’s statement is technically true with regard to the mining sector overall, linking it directly to coal is misleading.\\n\\nHealth Care\\n\\nAs the U.S. Senate considers a new health care plan, Trump told the Cedar Rapids audience the Affordable Health Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is dying, by which he meant “insurance companies have all fled” Iowa.\\n\\nWhile some insurers have pulled out, Minnesota-based Medica announced Monday it will sell individual insurance plans for the 2018 coverage year. As the last provider standing, Medica said it will increase rates an average 43.5 percent for all products.\\n\\nTrump could have said most insurance companies have fled and be right. As it was, the claim is false.\\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\nWhen lauding Iowa farming, Trump brought up the Obama administration’s Clean Water Rule, also called Waters of the United States, which clarifies the 1972 Clean Water Act to protect streams and wetlands.\\n\\nRepublicans reviled the rule, saying it was overly broad and confusing.\\n\\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT NEWS AND SPORTS The day's top stories right in your inbox.

Trump has asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps to reconsider the rules and the agencies have started that process. The U.S. Supreme Court is considering a case that deals with some aspects of the legislation.\\n\\nIt’s mostly false to imply Trump had a role in getting rid of the water rules.\\n\\n• This Fact Checker was researched and written by Erin Jordan, factchecker@thegazette.com.\",\n",

Some have even gone as far as to suggest that a highly advanced civilization inhabits a certain region of the moon, and that the existence of these “Aliens” has been covered up by NASA and the United States government.\\n\\nHave Ufologists gone too far this time? Or is it possible that there are structures on the moon According to THIS Ufologist, we are looking at clear images of a lunar city located inside a lunar crater, and we can all check it out using Google Earth.\\n\\nScott C. Waring, editor of the popular blog UFO Sightings Daily firmly believes he has found clear evidence of the existence of “little green men” on the surface of the moon. He believes that the alien city has been constructed on purpose inside the lunar crater. Mr. Waring used Google Moon to locate the crater found in the “Lacus Veris” region.\\n\\nIf you want to check out the alleged alien lunar city or yourself, head on over to this link and get yourself a cop of the software millions of people are using to explore the moon for crashed UFO’s, structures and cities.

The crater is located just below Lacus Veris and looks far from the norm of what humans would expect an alien structure to look like,” Waring writes. “Near it there is a crater that shows a face, with a large hat or hair, and an eating, the face shows an object like a snake or tough coming from its mouth.”\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time UFO hunters have found strange things on the Moon. According to many people, Earth’s natural satellite is in fact a giant Alien base, which is one of the main reasons humans have not visited the moon lately.\\n\\nSo, what are your thoughts?

When we asked them what they did with this information, they always gave evasive answers, saying it was up to their decision-makers”.\\n\\nThe Free Syrian Army, or FSA, was founded by a group of defected Syrian Armed Forces officers and soldiers in July 2011, and received backing from Britain and the US for its moderate line.\\n\\nLe Monde was shown photographs of a training camp in the northern province of Latakia frequented by foreign Isil fighters. “Naturally I transmitted this to my Western contacts with the GPS coordinates but had not response,” he is cited as saying. “Agents of mine also managed to get hold of phone numbers of Isil officials, serial numbers of satellite equipment and IP addresses. But once again, zero response.”\\n\\nPhoto: AFP\\n\\nIn 2014, FSA fighters under the banner Hazzm Movement were supplied anti-tank missiles in a covert CIA programme and received US military training in Qatar on their use.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2014, while Isil besieged Mossul in Iraq, “M” helped devise a secret plan presented to the Americans to rout Isil from northern Syria on the Azaz-Alep line. The plan was detailed street by street, hour by hour, and included the precise itinerary of fighters and their refuelling points. “In every village held by Daesh, knew the number of armed men, where their offices and hideouts were. We had located snipers and mines, we knew where the local emir slept, the colour of his car and even the brand. From a tactical and strategic point of view, we were ready,” he said.\\n\\nHowever, the Americans failed to give the green light, he said.\\n\\n“They were reluctant to provide us satellite images. They said their planes couldn’t help once the fighting with Isil started. All they offered us was to get rid of a few obstacles before the start of the offensive,” he said.\\n\\nHe then provided the US with details of the Isil command structure in Raqqa, from the emir to those in charge of checkpoints and pages of GPS coordinates. “That was a year and a half ago and Raqqa is still the capital of Daesh,” he said.',\n",

Like most priests who have been caught or convicted of sex acts, Davila went to another church. The problem, however, is no one at the church was told about his crimes.\\n\\nWhen the church of the Blessed Sacrament in Lawton, Oklahoma was introduced to Davila they were told only that “he has pastoral experience in the United States” but nothing about his criminal past or even the name of his previous church. None of the members hand any idea he was convicted for groping a teenager, according to KFOR News.\\n\\n“We’re very alarmed by this,” said David Clohessy, executive director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. “This is precisely the pattern that’s been in the Catholic Church for decades and it’s amazingly irresponsible.”\\n\\nFollowing Davila’s conviction, the church decided he was worthy of being reinstated and “fit to minister” to the public again. His sentence from the judge was three years probation and 150 hours of community service.\\n\\nIt seems, after serving his time, he left for another place his past wasn’t known. He’s now serving the small communities of Elgin, Apache and Sterling in Oklahoma. The combined population of these cities is a little over 4,000 people.\\n\\n“Yes he deserves a second chance but not in a position of trust and responsibility and authority and respect like a priest,” Clohessy explained. “And certainly not with no warnings to families around him. If a clergyman or woman abuses his authority and takes sexual advantage of a teenager we really think it should be exactly what the bishops promised it would be and that’s ‘one strike and you’re out.'”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t condemn a person for a maybe one-time offense,” said Fr. Michael Chapman, claiming that he believed Davila who promised the inappropriate touching of the teenager was an accident. “We don’t have a congregation of saints, we have a congregation of sinners, including the lead sinner, who is the priest.”\\n\\nUnderstandably, some members are a little uneasy about the Davila. Parishioner Janet Bullard fears for her family saying, “I have niece and nephews and I wouldn’t feel comfortable with this person working with any children. It’s hurtful this kind of stuff. It puts a stain on the church. Most of these people are good decent people and these scandals really hurt a lot of people and really ran a lot of people out of the church.”\\n\\nThe is the second story I’ve written in the last eight days about a church that hired someone convicted of a sex crime and didn’t tell their congregation about it.\\n\\nCheck out the full story from KFOR below:\\n\\n\",\n",

McMullin launched an independent presidential bid Monday. Photo via University of Pennsylvania\\n\\nEvan McMullin, the conservative Republican and former CIA officer making a late independent bid for the White House, is poised to get a boost from a new super PAC being formed by two GOP strategists with experience in third-party ballot access.\\n\\nKahlil Byrd, who served as chief executive of Americans Elect, a now-shuttered organization that sought to create a pathway for an independent presidential candidate in 2012, and Chris Ashby, a GOP campaign finance attorney who worked on that effort, are together launching a new super PAC called Stand Up America to support McMullin.\\n\\n\"We want to be the conduit for people to be able to stand up and not just support his candidacy, but the efforts of an independent to satisfy the American people’s need for something more than they have seen,\" Byrd told The Washington Post. \"We are down to the two major party candidates, yet people are still looking for someone else.\"\\n\\nUntil recently, Byrd had been serving as an adviser to Better for America, a nonprofit group that was laying the groundwork for a third-party candidate to gain ballot access this year. When he heard that McMullin was planning to run, Byrd resigned from the organization over the weekend so he and Ashby could launch the super PAC, he said. They did not discuss their plans with McMullin, Byrd added.\\n\\nIn the spring of 2016, Republican Evan McMullin spoke to the University of Pennsylvania\\'s Washington semester program about his views on the United States\\' ideological foundations. McMullin announced Aug. 8 that he\\'s running for president. (Penn in Washington)\\n\\nThe group faces a tight time frame in which to raise money and ramp up its operations. Byrd said the super PAC already has some financial commitments, which he declined to identify, adding that the organization plans to roll out a full political team later this week.\\n\\n\"The timeline is a quick one,\" Byrd acknowledged. \"We need to be active and operating at a high clip by the time we get to Labor Day.\"\\n\\nIndeed, McMullin\\'s late start puts him at a severe disadvantage, as he is entering the race long after ballot access has closed in many states. But both Byrd and Ashby said there was sufficient time for the first-time candidate to gain sufficient ballot access to put him in reach of 270 electoral votes, both through states still accepting signatures and others where his campaign could sue to gain access.\\n\\nAshby said the super PAC will not be involved in ballot access efforts, but will instead focus on voter outreach using \"all the tools at our disposal,\" including TV and digital ads, live events and grass-roots organizing.\\n\\n\"Our strategy will be focused on connecting and engaging the many millions of Americans who are hungry for another choice and an independent choice for president,\" Ashby said, adding: \"Anything is possible this year, and we think this is possible. We are going to run an aggressive, independent campaign.\"\\n\\nUntil Monday, McMullin, who was policy director for the House Republican Conference, had little public presence. But Byrd, who first met the former CIA operative in 2011 when he came to present a reform proposal on congressional gerrymandering to Americans Elect, said he believes McMullin\\'s independent candidacy will resonate.\\n\\n\"We’re at a moment where one of the significant parts of a candidate\\'s experiences that American voters are examining is foreign policy and understanding America’s place in the world, and Evan has lived that, as operative in CIA and more recently working in Congress,\" Byrd said, adding that McMullin is \"someone who is serious and stable and focused.\"',\n",

No1 of the list was an imminent move of Mario Balotelli from Liverpool to Olympiakos.\\n\\nMario Balotelli’s last performance of great value was against Germany for the Euro 2012 semi-final when he scored two goals to lead Italy to the final against Spain. Since then, the 24 year old’s career has fizzled out. He jumped from Manchester City to AC Milan and then to Liverpool unable to make a decent impression in either club.\\n\\nBrendan Rogers has used him a total of 16 times this season though he’s only managed to score twice and neither of them was for the Premier League. Liverpool’s atrocious run in the English league sees them in eighth place, 17 points behind first placed Chelsea and Manchester city. Consequently, people are brought up to target and the easiest one to blame is usually the team’s bad boy, which at this case is Super Mario.\\n\\nThe €20 million fee paid to bring the young Italian striker to the British port has yet to be depreciated as he has made no eminent impact in the team’s performance and so, tales of his departure are slowly arising.\\n\\nOne of them, has Balotelli moving to Olympiakos. Greece, a paradise for talented players who can still be paid well but also vamp around on the field, has always been the welcome area for cases like Balotelli. Eric Abidal and Javier Saviola to name a few recent ones, or Giovanni Dos Santos and Ze Elias to mention some past ones.\\n\\nAfter all, and this is where the article bases its whole theory, Mario Balotelli’s manager is the well known Mino Raiola (also represents Zlatan Ibrahimovic) who has three Olympiakos’ players under his belt, Gevorg Ghazaryan, Pajtim Kasami and Ibrahim Afellay and another, Vladimir Weiss who recently was sold off. Vaggelis Marinakis’ and Mino Raiola’s relationship is strengthened after their recent deals and as a result a forthcoming transaction between the two of them cannot be omitted.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

We have just the stop for you: Golden Oak Outpost.\\n\\nLocated near Splash Mountain, the little counter service stop offers a couple of hearty entree options as well as a few desserts.\\n\\nI’ve stopped here several times on my travels, especially when this used to be the home of McDonald’s French Fries in Magic Kingdom (“There’s Gold in Them There Fries!”). But I’ve never done a review for you, so let’s get started!\\n\\nAtmosphere\\n\\nGolden Oak Outpost sports the same rustic, Wild West feel that you encounter throughout Frontierland.\\n\\nThe name — Golden Oak — is a reference to Walt Disney’s Golden Oak Ranch in California. The name is found elsewhere at Walt Disney World in the ultra upscale neighborhood of single family homes that are being built adjacent to Fort Wilderness Campground nearby.\\n\\nSeating for Golden Oak Outpost is all outside. There are several tables and stools grouped next to the tiny quick service spot.\\n\\nIf it’s pouring rain or way too hot to sit outside, head over and snag a table at nearby Pecos Bill or Tortuga Tavern.\\n\\nThe kiosk is also located very close to the entry/exit gates for Magic Kingdom parades. Keep this in mind and plan accordingly if you think you might be grabbing some lunch or dinner here.\\n\\nEats\\n\\nThe menu at Golden Oak Outpost tends to vary according to season and crowd level. Pickings were slim the day that I visited, and consisted of two chicken options — a sandwich and nuggets. To round out the menu, there are also fries and a few dessert options as well as beverages.\\n\\nCondiments, plastic ware, and napkins are neatly arranged off to the right. And for such a small menu, there’s a surprising number of options! A couple of sauces are great for dipping nuggets, or even for dressing your sandwich or adding flavor to fries.\\n\\nSalt, pepper, and mustard are also handy in case you’d like to spice things up a bit.\\n\\nThere are also mayonnaise and ketchup for dressing and dipping.\\n\\nCondiments for your coffee and plastic ware for eating round out the offerings.\\n\\nWhen it was time to order, I went with the Fried Chicken Breast Sandwich. The sandwich comes dressed with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and ranch dressing. It’s kind of like having a side salad on your sandwich!\\n\\nIt’s also served with your choice of fries or apple slices. I went for the fries.\\n\\nThe sandwich was a keeper! The bun was a little nondescript, but the chicken was nicely seasoned and breaded with a juicy texture and good flavor. I could have done without the salad, but actually the shredded lettuce and diced tomato was a nice change from slabs of veggies.\\n\\nThe Fries are those wonderful standard Disney fries — medium-cut and fried to a perfectly crispy golden brown, but still soft inside.\\n\\nMy food was fresh, delicious, and best of all — fast.\\n\\nOverall\\n\\nYou probably aren’t going to make a special trip to Golden Oak Outpost. After all, the options here are available at lots of places.\\n\\nBut it is nice to know that you have some tasty choices way back in this corner of the park if you don’t want to queue up at the closest counter service. And if you happen to be waiting for the rest of your party to finish a ride and hunger strikes, this is a great spot to grab some nuggets or a sandwich.\\n\\nHave you ever stopped by Golden Oak Outpost?

The added intent element, moreover, makes no sense: The point of having a statute that criminalizes gross negligence is to underscore that government officials have a special obligation to safeguard national defense secrets; when they fail to carry out that obligation due to gross negligence, they are guilty of serious wrongdoing.

According to FSW sources, Affleck wants out of the film altogether. Which means he would no longer portray the Dark Knight in subsequent films set in the DC Extended Universe. In addition to Affleck ditching the project, recent hire Matt Reeves, director of Cloverfield and War for the Planet of the Apes, has already backed out as well.\\n\\nThis doesn’t bode well for fans of the series as similar situations have hit the production of The Flash film as well. But fear not faithful nerds, there is a new glimmer of hope for Batman!\\n\\nA trusted FSW source has reported that the genius filmmaker behind hits such as Chronicle and Fantastic Four has been tapped to direct, produce, write, and star in The Batman.\\n\\nThat’s right, Joshua Trank, the guy fired from the Boba Fett solo Star Wars anthology film, is taking over the next Batman film. But don’t worry folks, Trankman’s trusty sidekick, the screenwriter boy wonder, Max Landis will be assisting with writing duties. Landis is no stranger to the DC universe, as he has written a well-praised Superman comic and has a sequel story releasing sometime this year. The duo are a solid choice but what about Trank’s acting chops? Could he really replace Affleck as the Caped Crusader. Well, no. He doesn’t plan on portraying Batman, but rather he would be the main villain of the film: the Riddler, alongside Joe Manganiello’s Deathstroke.\\n\\nTrank as the Riddler? Sounds odd but okay, we’ll take it. Then what about the World’s Greatest Detective? Who will portray him since Affleck has departed? Christian Bale?\\n\\nAs it turns out The Force Awakens star, Oscar Isaac, is being eyed by Trank to be his Batman. Isaac would be the same Batman as Affleck’s similar to Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney all being the same Batman in the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher series of the late 80’s/early 90’s.\\n\\nAccording to a source close to Isaac, his Batman will be more of a detective than any previous film adaptation of the character, and the Riddler is a great psychological villain who could rival Heath Ledger’s Joker in The Dark Knight if portrayed correctly. Isaac is said to be close to sealing the deal with Trank and Landis for the project.\\n\\nStar Wars fans should be excited to see Oscar taking on a great lead role like this, but we at FSW are worried that another lackluster superhero film could tarnish his acting resume.

According to the study, this reversed chemical and behavioural effects of the THC and eliminated schizophrenia-like symptoms.\\n\\n“We were able to pharmacologically restore the GABA system in the prefrontal cortex and remarkably what we saw was that it actually reversed all these behaviour deficits associated with this THC exposure,” said Laviolette.\\n\\nMore research is still needed to determine if boosting GABA has the same result in humans, but for those who have mental health problems Laviolette says there’s new hope.\\n\\n“I think this is a really promising lead in terms of the potential of developing much safer versions of cannabinoid type drugs,” he said.\\n\\nLaviolette added that these findings are especially important given the impending legalization of marijuana in Canada.\\n\\n“What this could mean is that if you are going to be using marijuana, in a recreational or medicinal way, you can potentially combine it with compounds that boost GABA to block the negative effects of THC,” he said in a statement.\\n\\nLaviolette and his team are now looking towards finding more effective and safer treatments for mental health disorders, such as addiction, depression and anxiety.\\n\\nWith files from CTV London’s Celine Moreau',\n",

              " 'Lattice 3.0: Functional Programming in Rust\\n\\nAndrew Lucker Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jun 5, 2017\\n\\n… and there were many migraines throughout the kingdom.\\n\\nOur FRP windowing library “Lattice” is finally stabilizing on APIs. The dust is settling and the result is surprisingly clean. There were many times in the development of this library where this outcome was doubtful. For an example of what this library allows us to do, see the following code:\\n\\nv.append(Text::new(\"assets/Macondo-Regular.ttf\", \"paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified\").color([0.4, 0.4, 1.0, 1.0]).shadow([-3,-3,3,3],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]).scale(2.0, \"em\").width(25.0, \"%\").align(\"justify\").translate_x(150.0, \"px\").translate_y(150.0, \"px\"));\\n\\nThis code renders a long paragraph with justified text in a custom font and a host of other display properties. If you squint you might even be able to see the ghost of HTML/CSS. This type of code is coming to native thanks to a host of technological advancements. Rust is at the forefront of this movement towards further empowering the programmer while preventing much of the risk that comes with such powerful abstractions.\\n\\nThe real exciting parts start though with the FRP style. ReactJS for example is an FRP inspired framework, on native we do not have as powerful of abstractions. The web has nice abstractions at the cost of a huge complicated browser requirement. What is happening currently across native programming communities is a gradual unbundling of web front-end candy into smaller irreducible native elements.\\n\\nI am sponsoring Rust right now, but the same could be said about Swift for Mac and iOS. These languages are starting to pull in much of the spirit of the Functional Programming community and channel that energy into composable code. If there is one concept to takeaway from Functional, for me that would be composability. Being able to reuse concepts without boilerplate is the hallmark of mathematical reductionist philosophy.\\n\\nTo break down the above example, why FRP is such a breakthrough in interface concepts, the sanitization and declarative semantics are key. Take for example the same code in the dominant procedural style.\\n\\nVec<Glyphs> glyphs = font.render_glyphs(\"paragraph justified paragraph justified\", 2.0*EM)\\n\\napply_color(glyphs, [0.4, 0.4, 1.0, 1.0]);\\n\\napply_shadow(glyphs, [-3,-3,3,3],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]);\\n\\ntextwrap_justify(glyphs, 25.0, \"%\");\\n\\ntranslate_x(glyphs, 150.0, \"px\");\\n\\ntranslate_y(glyphs, 150.0, \"px\");\\n\\nThere are a couple of issues with this code. First, where is data coming from and where is it going. We can take it for granted that there is some global state being manipulated by all these elements. That alone basically rules out any clean threaded code. Second, there is an explosion of complexity in these methods. Do they work together well, or are there mutual incompatibilities. These are the things that are hard to test, even if they get integrated into the graphics platform.\\n\\nThis exploding complexity is the reason that graphics platforms are such timesinks and headaches for anyone that works with them. It’s not a programmer issue, it’s a language issue. Finally we have tools to address these design limitations, and the future is bright. Here is to more better faster UIs.',\n",

No surprise–they’re all for it.\\n\\n“Fracking’s Green Side” is the headline in the print edition. (The Web version is different.) The editors write:\\n\\nThose who would ban fracking or regulate it into oblivion ignore the exceptional benefits that inexpensive natural gas can provide in the biggest environmental fight of our time–against climate change.\\n\\nOf course, many people who fight climate change don’t think fracking is the answer. They point to the considerable local environmental hazards–water and air pollution, for starters–but they also question the argument that fracking is necessarily better for the climate.\\n\\nThe Post makes the argument that gas proponents most often cite: “Burning natural gas produces only about half the carbon emissions as burning coal.”\\n\\nBut as fracking critics point out, this is not the only impact it has on the climate. Here’s Neil deMause in Extra! (7/12):\\n\\nAny drilling for fossil fuels means more carbon will eventually be released into the atmosphere, but fracking’s effect on climate is compounded by the fact that the drilling process can create huge methane leaks: A study by Cornell scientists Robert Howarth and Anthony Ingraffea estimated that fracked wells leak 40 to 60 percent more methane than conventional wells (Scientific American, 1/20/12). Because methane is 20 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide, the National Center for Atmospheric Research has estimated that at these levels of leakage, switching from oil to natural gas consumption would significantly worsen global warming over the next several decades (Climate Progress, 9/9/11).\\n\\nThe Post doesn’t mention methane leaks. They do, however, approvingly cite research from a group called Resources for the Future, touting an energy future based on increased fracking.

              " '\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Bruce Levine–\\n\\nCHICAGO (CBS) — The center field position is manned by potential All-Star players on both the north and south sides of Chicago. With Jason Heyward signed for eight years with the Cubs and Adam Eaton under White Sox control for six more years (the team holds club options in 2021 and 2021), it would appear neither team has to worry about center field in the near future.\\n\\nOn the other hand, both clubs would be stronger on defense with these two quality players in right field. Heyward is a three-time Gold Glove winner in right field. Eaton had a difficult 2015 season on defense after showing much better skills the previous year. Before the club dealt away Trayce Thompson to the Dodgers in a deal to acquire third baseman Todd Frazier, White Sox manager Robin Ventura said in early December that the competition for the center field spot would be open this spring.\\n\\nWith that as context, we now turn our attention back to Dexter Fowler, a free agent who has yet to find a new home after submitting a quality season for the Cubs in 2015. Fowler had a (full-season) career-low .346 on-base percentage, but that’s still a good number in comparison to the league average mark of .317. Fowler was tied for 51st in on-base percentage in all of baseball. Playing in a career-high 152 games, he also was fourth in the National League with 104 runs scored and had a career-high 20 stolen bases.\\n\\nFowler declined the Cubs’ one-year qualifying offer of $15.8 million and has since watched the market for outfielders — and center fielders, more specifically — grind on at a really slow pace. So, if this slow free-agent market continues, is either Chicago team an option for the 30-year-old Fowler on a short-term basis?\\n\\nThe Cubs would have to make a decision on moving an outfielder before bringing Fowler back as an everyday player. The assumption would be that 23-year-old Jorge Soler could be moved in return for pitching, in either the rotation or bullpen, before bringing on Fowler would be considered.\\n\\nFor the White Sox, the switch-hitting Fowler would give them some speed at the top of the order, a respectable on-base percentage ahead of their sluggers and left-handed pop in their home run-friendly ballpark. Of Fowler’s 17 homers last season, 13 came from the left side.\\n\\nFowler was a mixed bag defensively in 2015. Not known for great range in the past, his path to the ball improved in 2015. The Wrigley Field bricks also weren’t inviting to an impending free agent like Fowler, who played better defense in road contests.\\n\\nFowler’s work ethic was intense last season. Both he and teammate Anthony Rizzo had head-spinning strength training workout regiments before every game. The reps alone would have worn out some Olympic hurdlers.\\n\\nThe Cubs coaching staff implored Fowler to lead with energy and plate discipline. He responded by drawing a career-high 84 walks, while also striking out 154 times. Cubs manager Joe Maddon and bench coach/outfield coach Davey Martinez were extremely influential in Fowler’s successful season.\\n\\nFowler has been trapped in the free-agent outfielder mix this offseason. On Thursday, Denard Span signed a three-year $31-million contract with the Giants. This may or may not be good news for Fowler, who made $9.5 million in 2015. Getting more money on average annually after the Span signing may be difficult, but several teams still would like to sign a center fielder.\\n\\nAmong potential contenders, only the Nationals, Rangers, Mariners, Indians, White Sox and Cubs are really any kind of fit for Fowler.\\n\\nBruce Levine covers the Cubs and White Sox for 670 The Score and CBSChicago.com.

              " 'Visiting Walt Disney World is a magical experience for a family. Often overlooked are the cast members who make those magical moments a reality. Sadly many guests don’t appreciate the work the cast members do, and sometimes are even disrespectful to the cast members. Cast members have to take on this rudeness and turn it into magical moments. It is not as easy of a job as most guests assume.\\n\\n1) Why yelling at the cast members won’t help\\n\\nYelling at a cast member when you are upset is the last thing you should do. Even if they have done something wrong, yelling at them won’t fix the problem. You are not going to get what you want out of yelling at the cast member. Asking your questions in a calm and collected manner to the cast member instead of yelling will allow the cast member to have an adult conversation that will most likely solve your problem.\\n\\nIf a certain cast member won’t listen to your recommendations, or is simply being inappropriate, then the best way to solve the problem is to go to guest services and report the incident. Simply asking to see the cast member’s name tag and then telling guest services at the front of the park is the best way to get the results you want.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2) Realizing it is probably not the cast member’s fault\\n\\nWhen an attraction is having technical issues, it is not the cast members fault. While working at the Magic Kingdom in 2013, I was told, “You’ve ruined my son’s vacation because ‘you’ broke this ride.” In reality my shift had just started, and I had no idea why the attraction wasn’t working. Before I could explain that I had just started my shift the women stormed away.\\n\\nA lot of times cast members are just relaying the message from someone else. When they tell you, “Sorry, you can’t bring your drink on this attraction” the cast members are not the ones who made up that rule. So don’t get mad at them, if you are truly upset with the rules then ask guest services about it.\\n\\n3) Following the cast member’s instructions\\n\\nWhen a cast member asks you to do something it most likely is for your own safety. They aren’t telling you what to do to be the fun police; they are telling you not to do something because they’ve already seen people get severely hurt doing it before. While Walt Disney World is meant to be a place where you can leave your responsibilities behind, it doesn’t mean you can leave your manners behind, and so by ignoring what the cast member is telling you it’s not only dangerous but also very rude.',\n",
              " 'There is a “shadow banking” system that has massively and often unknowingly leveraged client assets into possibly the largest credit bubble the world has ever seen. Because of more favorable rules, much of the leverage has occured in the Euro, meaning a collapse of the Euro will be much more catastrophic than the public is aware.\\n\\nOne of the shadow banking systems favorite tools is re-hypothocation. This means institutions can use client funds as collateral for the institutions own investments. The institutions take $1 of client collateral and use it to purchase $1.40 to $2.00 of investments for the institution. So for $1 of client money, the client may be trading at leverage, and the institution is trading at leverage.\\n\\nA much more thorough explantion is provided by Reuters, who concludes\\n\\nThe volume and level of re-hypothecation suggests a frightening alternative hypothesis for the current liquidity crisis being experienced by banks and for why regulators around the world decided to step in to prop up the markets recently. To date, reports have been focused on how Eurozone default concerns were provoking fear in the markets and causing liquidity to dry up. Most have been focused on how a Eurozone default would result in huge losses in Eurozone bonds being felt across the world’s banks. However, re-hypothecation suggests an even greater fear. Considering that re-hypothecation may have increased the financial footprint of Eurozone bonds by at least four fold then a Eurozone sovereign default could be apocalyptic.\\n\\nFor further reading we suggest this dire post from zerohedge.com, who sees truly frightening possiblities\\n\\nIt turns out the next AIG was among us all along, only because it was hidden\\n\\ndeep in the bowels of the unmentionable shadow banking system, out of sight (by\\n\\ndefinition) meant out of mind. Only it was not: and at last check there\\n\\nwas $15 trillion in the shadow banking system in the US alone, where the\\n\\ndaisy chaining of counteparty risk meant that any liquidity risk flare up would\\n\\nmean the AIG bankruptcy was not even a dress rehearsal for the grand finale.\\n\\nThe real threat is not the collapse of financial institutions, but the threat of governments stepping in to resuce so called “to big to fail” insitutions. Governments don’t have the money, so they will print it up via the central banks. This will certainly lead to inflation, and perhaps hyper-inflation.\\n\\nA more hopeful opinion on the odds of hyper-inflation is provided by dailycapitalist.com',\n",

On his tour, he had met the family of Mark Fortune. Sloper apparently became so fond of Alice Fortune that he cancelled his passage on the Mauretania and booked instead on the Titanic which he boarded at Southampton as a first class passenger.\\n\\nWhen the Titanic struck the iceberg, Sloper was playing bridge with some friends. Sloper was rescued in lifeboat 7. The lifeboat was one of the early boats sent away and First Officer William Murdoch was freely allowing men into the starboard side lifeboats when there were no women around.\\n\\nAccording to Mr Sloper, he owed his life to Dorothy Gibson, an actress and one of his bridge companions, who got into the lifeboat and insisted that he join her. He pointed out that many persons aboard felt that the Titanic was \"unsinkable\" and therefore, did not want to leave the well-lit deck to set off into the dark waters in small boats.\\n\\nWhen the Carpathia arrived in New York, Sloper was, naturally, inundated by members of the press - as were all survivors.

On the advice of his father, other family members and trusted friends, Sloper did not sue the Herald nor the reporter. He decided that the fuss would eventually pass; He spent the rest of his life refuting the charge.\\n\\nFollowing the disaster, Sloper became a managing partner of Judd & Co. in New Britain, a private investment firm which in 1926 succeeded the former New York Stock Exchange firm of Judd & Co.\\n\\nHe married Mrs Helen Tallmadge Lindenberg on 26 February 1915 in Columbus, Ohio and raised her three daughters from a previous marriage.

              " 'LOMA MAR — A 77-year-old concrete dam is now gone from San Mateo County’s Pescadero Creek, opening a route for rare coho salmon to once again return to their ancestral habitat.\\n\\nThe dam created a popular swimming hole at Memorial Park in the redwood forests of the Santa Cruz Mountains, where kids floated on air mattresses in the chilly waters and searched for crayfish.\\n\\nBut it prevented the fish from making their swim from the Pacific Ocean to freshwater pools to spawn. The coho was listed as endangered in 2005 and is now on the brink of extinction.\\n\\nThe dam was demolished in October by a team led by the San Mateo County Resource Conservation District and San Mateo County Parks Department — and December rains have restored the creeks natural contours, opening up 62 miles of creek habitat to the fish.\\n\\n“We’re trying to give them a fighting chance, where they come to spawn,” said Kellyx Nelson, executive director of the San Mateo County Resource Conservation District, based in Half Moon Bay.\\n\\n“We’re doing everything in our power to make sure they have the right habitat to feed, grow fat and lay their eggs before going back out to sea,” she said.\\n\\nThe dam was built in 1938 to provide a swimming hole near the confluence of Peterson and McCormick creeks, part of the Works Progress Administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal to combat unemployment in the Great Depression.\\n\\nBut it created an insurmountable barrier for fish in the coastal creek. The dam wall was too high for fish to jump when traveling upstream. And its narrow chute forced a fierce flow of water, too strong to overcome. And it prevented the downstream flow of gravel, essential for fish to lay eggs. An additional problem — also now fixed, as part of this restoration project — was created by a 1930s-era road crossing, designed to provide vehicle access to the park’s Sequoia Flat Family Camp.\\n\\n“These are great projects which benefit fish — the result of many years of planning, layers of initiatives,” said Marlene Finley, director of the San Mateo Parks Department.\\n\\nOnce Pescadero Creek — whose name is Spanish for fish merchant — teemed with coho salmon, as well as steelhead trout. While steelhead are still found in Pescadero Creek, coho were believed to have vanished from its waters.\\n\\nCoho, also known as silver salmon, are born in cold freshwater streams like Pescadero Creek, where they live for a year before swimming to the ocean. Then they return to lay eggs and fertilize them.\\n\\nLast winter, to great excitement, biologists spotted three coho salmon that had recently spawned, including a 26-inch female. Those adult fish are believed to have originated in Santa Cruz County’s Kingfisher Flat Hatchery on Big Creek, a project of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and state fisheries.\\n\\nBut no fry were detected.\\n\\nThis is the fifth barrier to be removed by the San Mateo County Resource Conservation District since 2007. The project received about $280,000 in funding from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, with additional funding and effort from the conservation district and the San Mateo County Parks and Recreation Foundation.\\n\\nOf previous projects, the most formidable was the 2013 removal of a century-old 40-foot-wide concrete barrier from a section of the creek in El Palo Alto Park on the Palo Alto-Menlo Park border, restoring the streambed to a more natural course.\\n\\nAs winter rains deposit necessary gravel and cause the newly restored creek to swell, biologists will watch closely for the fish to return.\\n\\n“This is the time of year that we might start to see fish migrate up creeks,” said Nelson. “I’m hoping.”',\n",

Bushido must immediately remove this from his Twitter page, otherwise he can no longer serve as an example of successful integration,” German Federal Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich demanded in a statement to Bild am Sonntag.\\n\\nIn 2011, Bushido won a “Bambi” award as a role model for “integration,” although the rapper has previously been the subject of controversy, drawing accusations that he has produced homophobic and misogynist lyrics.\\n\\n“The message of the image is clear: a two-state solution with Israel and a Palestinian state existing in peace is not acceptable,” alleged an overwrought article in Süddeutsche Zeitung. “There is no room for a Jewish state.”\\n\\n“It is scandalous that a German musician who is so accomplished should question the existence of Israel in this way,” Ruprecht Polenz, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the German parliament told the newspaper.\\n\\nZionist organizations have jumped on the bandwagon. Drawing attention to Bushido’s ancestry, the World Jewish Congress issued a statement titled “German rapper wipes Israel off the map”:\\n\\nBushido, who was born as Anis Mohamed Youssef Ferchichi to a Tunisian father and a German mother, has more than 285,000 followers on Twitter. He has not explained what he meant by posting the map, which is used as propaganda by Hamas and other extremist Palestinian organizations who deny Israel’s right to exist.\\n\\nMany Zionists have long held that for Palestinians to merely recall the historic fact that their country was unified and that they lived in all parts of it before the 1947-48 Zionist ethnic cleansing and violent partition is illegitimate and hateful.\\n\\nAny sort of criticism of Israel has been frequently silenced in Germany by reference to the country’s crimes during the Second World War, assisted by many complicit European authorities, whose motivation was to exterminate European Jews.\\n\\nSo it is sadly no surprise that Israel’s actual and ongoing efforts to erase Palestinians from their land – not merely from maps – through relentless colonization of occupied territories and racist laws to “Judaize” the whole country – have rarely caused as much outrage in Germany as Bushido’s Twitter avatar.\\n\\nIndeed, despite Israel’s flagrant and accelerating efforts to steal as much land as possible in violation of international law, the German government continues to be a staunch ally of Israel, helping to make the Middle East a more dangerous place by providing nuclear-missile capable submarines to Israel.\\n\\nThe only message Israel can take from German complicity and irresponsibility is one of encouragement and support to commit more war crimes against Palestinians and others.\\n\\nBut German politicians, it seems, only find their courage when a rapper changes his Twitter avatar.',\n",

He received a Bachelor of Arts in English at the Western Reserve University in 1959 and a Master of Arts in 1962. He also won the Finley Foster Poetry Prize and the Holden Essay Award for some of his poetry.\\n\\nInitially, his career as a writer was part time writing short fiction and only in 1965 a cut version of his novel “.. . And Call Me Conrad ” was published in “The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction”. In 1966 the novel was published as an integral version as a book with the title “This Immortal”. The novel won the Hugo Award.\\n\\n“This Immortal” contains some of the most typical themes of Roger Zelazny’s works with the presence of characters who are god-like or at least supehuman. There’s also the inspiration to mythology, in this case Greek, but in his works the author used elements of mythologies from all over the world and even the Cthulhu Mythos.\\n\\nIn 1965 Roger Zelazny also published the novella “He Who Shapes”, winner of the Nebula Award, which was expanded into the novel “The Dream Master” in 1966. In 1967 Roger Zelazny published the novel “Lord of Light”, who won the Hugo Award.\\n\\nAfter a few years, his achievements convinced Roger Zelazny to devote himself full time to being a writer. In 1969 he published the novels “Isle of the Dead”, winner of the Prix Tour-Apollo Award in France, and “Damnation Alley”, another expansion of a novella.\\n\\nIn 1970 Roger Zelazny published the first book of his fantasy cycle of the Chronicles of Amber “Nine Princes in Amber”. The first five books, published in the 1970s, describe the adventures of Prince Corwin of Amber and are for this reason also called the Corwin series.\\n\\nDuring the 1970s Roger Zelazny kept on publishing science fiction stories as well, winning the Hugo and Nebula awards for the novella “Home is the Hangman”. In 1976 he published the novel written in collaboration with Philip K. Dick “Deus Irae”.\\n\\nThe 1980s brought other successes to Roger Zelazny, in both the science fiction and fantasy genres. His 1981 novelette “Unicorn Variation” won the Hugo Award. His 1981 novel “The Changing Land” won the Locus Fantasy Award. His 1985 novella “24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai” won the Hugo Award. His 1986 novelette “Permafrost” won the Hugo Award.\\n\\nIn 1985, Roger Zelazny published the first book of the Merlin series, which includes the other five books of the Chronicles of Amber focused on the adventures of Corwin’s son. It’s “The Trumps of Doom”, winner of the Locus Fantasy Award.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, Roger Zelazny completed the Chronicles of Amber and published some works written in collaboration such as “Bring Me the Head of the Prince Charmingt” in 1991, “If at Faust You Don’t Succeed” in 1993 and “A Farce to be Reckoned With” in 1995, a humorous fantasy mini-cycle written with Robert Sheckley.\\n\\nRoger Zelazny died on June 14, 1995 because of a cancer that also caused him kidney failure. Some works were published posthumously such as “Psycoshop” in 1998, a novel started by Alfred Bester.

That may change the frequency of space flights by Canadian astronauts, he added.\\n\\nBut he said things could be different in four or five years, when NASA is expected to have built a new space vehicle.\\n\\nNASA is also planning to change its focus to services provided in orbit and rely increasingly on the commercial sector to take humans and cargo into orbit.\\n\\n\"I think that provides an opportunity for Canadian industry to participate,\" MacLean said.\\n\\nOn Friday, MacLean was set to watch Atlantis\\'s final launch, along with Industry Minister Christian Paradis and Gary Goodyear, Minister of State for Science and Technology.\\n\\nHe said he felt nostalgic when he saw the shuttle on the launch pad.\\n\\n\"I think that\\'s the mood that\\'s here today — it\\'s one of celebrating these last moments of an amazing program.\"',\n",

              " 'Scientists are a skeptical bunch. We never accept claims without evidence and we spend large parts of our careers trying to show that other scientist\\'s claims are wrong. This self scrutiny is one of our best traits, and it is a major reason why science advances over time.\\n\\nWith this said, it often surprises people that scientists are in such strong agreement about human impacts on the Earth\\'s climate. Many studies, including research by Doran and Zimmerman, Anderegg and colleagues, and more recently by my colleague\\'s team, Cook et al., have shown conclusively that the world\\'s climate scientists agree, to about 97 percent, that humans are significantly impacting the climate. But many people ask, how can they be so sure?\\n\\nThere are a number of reasons why we know humans are causing many of the changes we are seeing today. Among them, is the use of attribution studies, often called \"fingerprinting\". Scientists look at the patterns of climate change and ask, do they have the fingerprint of natural variation, or humans?\\n\\nOne of the most well-known climate change attribution scientists is Dr. Benjamin Santer. He and his team have developed tools to separate natural climate variations from human-induced changes by using a number of different tools. Their latest work was just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and is titled \"Human and Natural Influences on the Changing Thermal Structure of the Atmosphere\".\\n\\nThe method is somewhat complex; it involves the comparison of climate observations with the output of climate models. Specifically, they compared satellite observations from two different groups, with output from 20 climate models that participated in the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP-5). In the models, they calculated what the Earth would be like without us. The \"world without us\" scenarios have natural changes to the environment caused by volcanoes, the Sun, and internal climate variability (phenomena like El Niños and La Niñas). They wanted to know whether the \"world without us\" could have displayed the types of changes to the climate that we are seeing today.\\n\\nNext, the scientists calculated what the Earth would be like if human emissions had occurred, but natural variations in volcanoes and the Sun had not. These \"human only\" simulations tell us what we expect the impact to be from greenhouse emissions alone; they give us an estimate of the human \"fingerprint\".\\n\\nFinally, the models were used to estimate the amount of internal variability in the climate, without human impacts or forced changes from volcanoes and the sun. This third step quantifies the impact of things like El Niños, La Niñas, and other natural variations.\\n\\nWith these three calculations complete, the scientists then went to the observational record, extracting data from satellite measurements of the Earth\\'s climate. They searched the measurements for the \"human only effect\" by comparing the measurements to the three sets of simulations. In particular, they looked at the signal-to-noise ratio, which helps tell them which of the three solutions (\"world without us\", \"human only\" or \"natural variability\") fit the observations best.\\n\\nWhat did they find? Certain patterns emerge that are consistent with the \"human only\" scenario. For instance, the heating of the lower atmosphere and cooling of the upper atmosphere, which satellites clearly see, could only happen if human emissions were the culprit. But the study went further; they actually stacked the deck of cards in favor of nature. They used solar and volcanic variations much larger than those that actually occurred since 1979. The strategy was to see if even a worst case \"world without us\" could be made to look like the current measurements. But, even that didn\\'t work. The human influence still stood out.\\n\\nPerhaps the best summary is in the abstract of the paper.\\n\\n\"We show that a human-caused latitude/altitude pattern of atmospheric temperature change can be identified with high statistical confidence in satellite data. Results are robust to current uncertainties in models and observations … Our results provide clear evidence for a discernible human influence on the thermal structure of the atmosphere\".\\n\\nIn climate science, as with most science, formal proofs are not possible. But I\\'ve read hundreds or perhaps thousands of scientific articles in my life, and this is about as convincing as it gets.',\n",

A quick comparison of the codecs used on these “new” aXXo releases and an examination of some of the metadata such as the ripping software and specs, clearly shows that it is not the same aXXo his fans know and love.\\n\\nAlso, it is a bit strange that the mystical aXXo only uploaded his releases sporadically onto the Speed.cd tracker before he stopped releasing on public sites three months ago. To us, these are all clear signs that we’re dealing with an impostor here.\\n\\nFor years aXXo has been warning followers to “beware of bogus sites and lamers,” but apparently that didn’t help much.

In the comments he is chatting with his new found fans and explaining why he decided to leave Mininova and Demonoid.\\n\\nThe site’s operators on the other hand are welcoming the many donations made by aXXo’s followers. “Since axxo is part of this site I have donated $10,” one user commented after buying some upload credit and VIP status. There are even better deals though. Three months of VIP access is only $50 and you’ll get a star next to your nickname as bonus.\\n\\nThen again, if thousands of people can’t spot the difference between the uploads of aXXo and the fake aXXo, does it really matter? We’re inclined to say no, if it wasn’t for the price lists and money begging going on at that site.\\n\\nLet’s hope that they don’t have the MPAA fooled and end up with their servers raided by the authorities.

              " 'Donald Trump\\'s executive order to ban citizens of seven countries from entering the US has no parallel in American history, says Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security under Barack Obama.\\n\\nKayyem says, usually, there are processes in place to vet executive orders before they\\'re issued — processes the Trump administration declined to follow in favor of a \"disruptive\" management style. But that also meant there weren\\'t any agency officials with advance knowledge of the order who could smooth the implementation hurdles.\\n\\nWithout anyone with a clear sense of the plan, one border agent directed questions to the president himself. It was 24 hours before a judge ruled the order shouldn\\'t apply to those already en route to the US, and another day later before the administration ruled the order did not apply to green card holders.\\n\\nThese are all clear signs that none of the proper authorities, departments, organizations or institutions were contacted, Kayyem says. If they had, she explains, the order would have been more detailed, and exceptions would have been identified. The Pentagon, for example, has been working to bring Iraqi translators and support staff to the US — an effort now frozen by the order.\\n\\nOn Monday, the Pentagon said it was preparing a list of Iraqi translators who should be allowed into the US despite the order.\\n\\nSo why the rush to implement the measures? It\\'s unclear, Kayyem says. She says, as far as she knows, there was no specific threat from any of the seven countries. Many security personnel, 90 percent of whom are non-partisan \"career professionals\" are deeply concerned that the president appears to be acting without advice from his own cabinet, let alone members of the US security community, she adds.\\n\\n\"Make no mistake about it,\" she warns. \"What Donald Trump did has no parallel in American history.\"\\n\\nSo what\\'s next? The courts, Kayyem suggests. But this \"fight,\" as she calls it, is unlikely to stay in the judiciary.\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to see this battle cross branches and departments,\" and, in the end, Kayyem predicts it may just go back to how it was before.

Human shows were organized in various European and American cities and obtained great success, often attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors.\\n\\nOne human zoo was also present during the first World’s Fair held in Paris in 1899.\\n\\nThe people, mostly put on display in cages and fenced areas, were people taken from the African continent or America and were kept with typical clothing or sometimes naked.\\n\\nThe purpose of these zoos was primarily to show the variety of human beings present in the world, sometimes classifying them as past evolutionary levels. Sometimes entire villages were rebuilt to show how the natives lived in different countries.\\n\\nOta Benga\\n\\nOne of the most famous people on display in a human zoo was Ota Benga, a Congolese pygmy who was kept in a fenced area with the company of a monkey.\\n\\nOta had escaped the massacre of his village by Belgian settlers because he was out hunting. On his return he was captured by slavers who later sold him to Samuel Phillips Verner, who was in Africa to look for subjects to be put on display in the zoo.\\n\\nVerner bought Ota in exchange for salt and clothes. Although it may sound strange, this was the salvation for Ota that otherwise would have ended up being used as a slave on plantations.\\n\\nThe boy and Verner established a strong bond and when Verner travelled back to Africa he brought with him. Ota however, no longer feeling he belonged to these people, decided to return to the United States.\\n\\nThe Hottentot Venus\\n\\nAnother star of the human zoo was Saartjie Baartman, also known as the “Hottentot Venus”.\\n\\nSaartjie was a Khoikhoi woman from South West Africa who had steatopygia, a condition of lordosis and strong predisposition to accumulate fat on the buttocks, typical of some African populations.\\n\\nShe was captured and sold to a London entrepreneur when she was twenty and was shown in various exhibitions, almost naked to show her body then considered very unusual.\\n\\nThe end of human zoos\\n\\nIn the first half of ‘900 some people began to feel indignant towards these human zoos and slowly they began to be abolished.\\n\\nThe last was abolished in Belgium in 1958 but the first was oddly abolished by Hitler, BBC reports.',\n",

That's according to Pewter Report, who published a column filled with notes on the Bucs' efforts in free agency yesterday.

Averaging just 3.7 yards per carry since then, the Muscle Hamster has looked more like an eminently replaceable backup than a capable starter over the past two years. Martin's issues had a variety of causes, but one of those causes was his own play.\\n\\nThat wasn't lost on the Bucs, who re-signed Bobby Rainey this offseason and drafted Charles Sims last year. With Mike James in the building too, they have the talent in place to replace Martin by a committee.\\n\\nBut that doesn't appear to be the team's preference. Pewter Report notes that not only would the Bucs be interested in trading for Adrian Peterson at a cheap price, they also pursued DeMarco Murray, who turned out to be too expensive for their liking.\\n\\nIt seems pretty clear that the Bucs are willing to move on from Martin, and want to find a real back they can count on.

Now, the Identitarians have established themselves as an alternative, aiming to be a “patriotic Greenpeace-type organization”, as their Vienna-branch leader Martin Sellner puts it.\\n\\nRecent stunts include blocking the A4 road near Nickelsdorf, occupying a border post in Salzburg, and building a border fence on the Austrian-Hungarian border.\\n\\nThe group says it has used social media to reach thousands of people since the start of the refugee crisis in September. They want Syrians to seek refuge in regions in the Middle East or North Africa. They claim that proceeds from their “border helper” (Grenzhelfer) stunts will be going to World Vision to support refugees in safe zones neighbouring Syria – rather than in Europe.\\n\\nAlexander Markovics, who heads up Austria’s Identitarian movement, believes that “Europe can never hope to solve the migrant crisis and world poverty through immigration”.\\n\\nHe claims it is short-sighted and culturally-destructive for all involved. “Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and other nearby countries are more logical destinations for them, and this is where Europe should be focusing aid efforts and diplomatic leverage,” he adds.\\n\\nWhile there is some disagreement on how to classify the Identitarian movement politically – whether it be far-right, right, or ‘new right’ – they represent something distinct from traditional right-wing groups of the post-war period.\\n\\nAs Europe becomes more polarized on issues of culture and migration, a part of Austrian society is seeing this position as more reasonable than they otherwise might have in the recent past.\\n\\nAccording to Julian Bruns, an expert on far-right movements, when talking about the Identitarians it is important to keep in mind that they don’t bring violence to the streets, instead it is their messages that present a danger because they know how to package them well.\\n\\nHe says that since the movement’s beginnings in France in 2012, it has been made up of students, not skinheads, who use popular culture and new right rhetoric to attract young adults to their movement.\\n\\nThe social anxiety over the migrant crisis that Austria’s Identitarians are tapping into, is also facilitating a boost in popularity for the Freedom Party. The FPO, campaigning to reduce immigration, could conceivably win a majority in Vienna’s October elections – something that would have been unthinkable a generation ago.\\n\\nMany Identitarians have links to the Freedom Party, and the FPO’s recent success in Upper Austria’s state elections was marked with jubilation on some of the movement’s social media profiles.\\n\\nPotentially even deeper than the divisions highlighted by the Greek debt crisis earlier this summer, the current refugee crisis has exposed profound differences among Europeans on the direction, role, and even definition of Europe.',\n",
              " 'OTTAWA -- Canada\\'s banking watchdog unveiled tougher mortgage-financing rules that take effect on Jan. 1 that real estate watchers and economists say could dramatically slow house buying and borrowing.\\n\\nThe measures were first proposed in July, amid heightened concern over rapid house-price appreciation in the greater Toronto area, Canada\\'s largest urban center, and surrounding communities in southern Ontario. Since the proposal, the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate twice, and governor Stephen Poloz said in July concerns over financial stability played a role in the policy-decision making process.\\n\\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions confirmed Tuesday the measures they proposed will kick in, and real estate watchers say the regulator has crafted tougher rules than originally envisaged.\\n\\nThe most notable measure is a provision that would require all prospective buyers -- even those with a down payment of over 20% -- to undergo a so-called stress test before a bank can issue a loan. Previously, only buyers with a down payment of less than 20% had to undergo a stress test. Under the stress test, prospective buyers would have to qualify for a mortgage at a rate at whichever is greater: either 2 percentage points above the negotiated rate, or the Bank of Canada\\'s five-year benchmark rate. The central bank\\'s five-year rate stands at 4.89%. The regulator originally proposed the test just cover two percentages point above the negotiated mortgage.\\n\\n\"These revisions reinforce a strong and prudent regulatory regime for residential mortgage underwriting in Canada,\" said Jeremy Rudin, head of the banking watchdog.\\n\\nRobert McLister, founder of the Canadian mortgage-rate comparison site RateSpy.com, said the new rules target the fastest-growing part of the mortgage market -- uninsured mortgages -- and could affect one out of every six prospective home buyers. In Canada, mortgage insurance is mandatory unless the buyer has a down payment of 20% and over.\\n\\n\"This is easily the most groundshaking mortgage rule of all time, and that\\'s not an understatement,\" Mr. McLister said in an interview.\\n\\nEconomists said the tougher mortgage regulations will further hit a softening housing market. Recent data from the Canadian Real Estate Association indicated unadjusted sales in September were 11% below year-ago levels, and price growth has slowed considerably, especially in the Toronto market after the introduction of a foreign-buyer\\'s tax in southern Ontario.\\n\\n\"This will have a far greater impact on house prices than the Bank of Canada recent interest rate hikes,\" said David Madani, economist at forecasting firm Capital Economics. \"Needless to say, these latest mortgage rule changes will have a negative impact on house prices and household wealth.\"\\n\\nTD Bank\\'s economics team said it anticipates the measures will depress housing demand by 5% to 10% once fully implemented.\\n\\nBesides universal stress testing, Canada\\'s banking regulator has also ordered lenders to require the loan-to-value ratio used in evaluating a mortgage \"remain dynamic\" and adjust for local market conditions, and prohibit co-lending arrangements that potentially circumvent existing regulations.\\n\\nIn its most recent assessment of the financial system, the Bank of Canada said more than 80% of new mortgage lending by Canada\\'s big six banks in the Toronto and Vancouver areas covers uninsured mortgages.\\n\\nOne key reasons is that earlier this decade, the Canadian government opted to no longer backstop mortgage insurance on homes valued at 1 million Canadian dollars ($796,000) or greater.\\n\\nIn its review, the Bank of Canada said the proportion of highly indebted uninsured mortgage holders -- incorporating a loan-to-income ratio of over 450% -- rose to 17% last year from 12% in 2014.\\n\\nBruce Joseph, head of Anthem Mortgage Group in Barrie, Ontario, said some mortgage brokers and real-estate agents reckoned the banking regulator would lighten up on some the rules given the recent spell of softness in Canadian house-sale activity. \"They didn\\'t. This is aggressive,\" Mr. Joseph said.

              " 'OTTAWA—While some Canadians unwrapped new video game systems over the holidays, the Canadian Armed Forces looked to develop their own. The Forces are planning to buy a motion-capture suit that would “dramatically upgrade” their virtual reality training programs.\\n\\nA woman wearing 3D glasses tests a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) virtual reality theatre during its presentation at the Industrial Centre for Virtual Reality in Saint-Nazaire, France in December. ( GEORGES GOBET / AFP/GETTY IMAGES ) Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs is photographed in a spandex suit prior to a motion capture session at the Electronic Arts studios in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. The video game industry is outspending the Canadian Armed Forces in virtual reality spending. ( Jeff Vinnick / Electronic Arts/GETTY IMAGES file photo )\\n\\nThey plan to use the suit, complete with 19 separate sensors, to make their virtual training more realistic, modelling complex and detailed environments in what’s called a Corner Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (Corner CAVE) system. “The Corner CAVE is a cutting-edge system designed to create virtual 3D reproductions of anything that can be modelled in 3D, such as mechanical sub-components of an engine, a complex weapon system, or a piece of terrain,” according to an advertisement for the new suit. “The incorporation of this upgraded capability would greatly increase the scope of projects that could be encompassed under the Corner CAVE system.”\\n\\nArticle Continued Below\\n\\nThe system projects the virtual environment onto two or three walls to provide an encompassing environment for training. In the military context, the Corner CAVE can be used for everything from small arms training to realistic lessons on repairing equipment in the field, from interacting with local populations to treating soldiers dealing with post-traumatic stress. It’s not clear how much the motion-capture suit will cost. Estimates from lower-end suits are in the hundreds of dollars, with higher-end equipment costing significantly more. The Forces have requested bids from suppliers by Jan. 12. The Forces says it needs the suit to further develop its Corner CAVE training programs.\\n\\nThe current motion-capture system at CFB Gagetown in Oromocto, N.B., can capture movements only in an eight-foot by eight-foot area. Because it’s a camera-based system, it is difficult to accurately map interactions with equipment. Props used in the system also block the camera’s line of sight between the cameras and the motion-capture sensors. The system also requires six hours to set up and calibrate.\\n\\nArticle Continued Below\\n\\nThe Forces are increasingly turning to virtual reality, including video games, to help train their personnel for real-life missions. The Canadian Press reported in December 2003 that some in the Forces were skeptical of the turn to the virtual, calling it a cost-cutting tool that can’t replace physical drills. But Maj. Sam Pollock said the virtual training is not meant to replace those drills, but to augment them and speed soldiers’ training. “In my opinion, (with) current technologies . . . there’s always going to be a compromise with simulations. You’re never going to be able to perfectly replicate the real, actual, live sort of field environment,” said Pollock in an interview earlier this month. “But, on the other hand, you can optimize that time you spend in the field by using simulations in advance, going through your basic weapons handling drills without actually being in a live-fire (environment). Where you’ve got a very low-stress environment, and you can actually then go on to the live-firing portion and be much more effective.” Another advantage, Pollock says, is that by simulating repairs on an engine or the handling of complex weapon systems, the actual engines and weapon systems can be deployed in the field if need be. The development of virtual training took off within the Forces around 2007, according to Pollock, when the army realized they needed to quickly address a “shortfall in certain training capacities” in the military. The army now has more than 230 simulators in 125 locations, with seven primary sites. It’s not only the military looking to advance this type of technology, however. Pollock said the video game industry is actually outspending the Canadian Armed Forces on these technologies. Something to think about next time you’re playing Call of Duty.',\n",
              " 'A possible treatment for dementia? Drinking five cups of coffee a day could reverse memory problems seen in Alzheimer\\'s disease, US scientists say. The Florida research, carried out on mice, also suggested caffeine hampered the production of the protein plaques which are the hallmark of the disease. Previous research has also suggested a protective effect from caffeine. But British experts said the Journal of Alzheimer\\'s disease study did not mean that dementia patients should start using caffeine supplements. The results are particularly exciting in that a reversal of pre-existing memory impairment is more difficult to achieve\\n\\nDr Gary Arendash\\n\\nUniversity of South Florida The 55 mice used in the University of South Florida study had been bred to develop symptoms of Alzheimer\\'s disease. First the researchers used behavioural tests to confirm the mice were exhibiting signs of memory impairment when they were aged 18 to 19 months, the equivalent to humans being about 70. Then they gave half the mice caffeine in their drinking water. The rest were given plain water. The mice were given the equivalent of five 8 oz (227 grams) cups of coffee a day - about 500 milligrams of caffeine. The researchers say this is the same as is found in two cups of \"specialty\" coffees such as lattes or cappuccinos from coffee shops, 14 cups of tea, or 20 soft drinks. When the mice were tested again after two months, those who were given the caffeine performed much better on tests measuring their memory and thinking skills and performed as well as mice of the same age without dementia. Those drinking plain water continued to do poorly on the tests. In addition, the brains of the mice given caffeine showed nearly a 50% reduction in levels of the beta amyloid protein, which forms destructive clumps in the brains of dementia patients. Further tests suggested caffeine affects the production of both the enzymes needed to produce beta amyloid. The researchers also suggest that caffeine suppresses inflammatory changes in the brain that lead to an overabundance of the protein. Earlier research by the same team had shown younger mice, who had also been bred to develop Alzheimer\\'s but who were given caffeine in their early adulthood, were protected against the onset of memory problems. \\'Safe drug\\' Dr Gary Arendash, who led the latest study, told the BBC: \"The results are particularly exciting in that a reversal of pre-existing memory impairment is more difficult to achieve. \"They provide evidence that caffeine could be a viable \\'treatment\\' for established Alzheimer\\'s disease and not simply a protective strategy. \"That\\'s important because caffeine is a safe drug for most people, it easily enters the brain, and it appears to directly affect the disease process.\" The team now hope to begin human trials of caffeine to see if the mouse findings are replicated in people. They do not know if a lower amount of caffeine would be as effective, but said most people could safely consume the 500 milligrams per day. However they said people with high blood pressure, and pregnant women, should limit their daily caffeine intake. Rebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer\\'s Research Trust, said: \"In this study on mice with symptoms of Alzheimer\\'s, researchers found that caffeine boosted their memory. We need to do more research to find out whether this effect will be seen in people. \"It is too early to say whether drinking coffee or taking caffeine supplements will help people with Alzheimer\\'s. Neil Hunt, chief executive of the Alzheimer\\'s Society, said previous research into caffeine had suggested it could delay Alzheimer\\'s disease and even protect against vascular dementia. \"This research in mice suggests that coffee may actually reverse some element of memory impairment. \"However much more research is needed to determine whether drinking coffee has the same impact in people. \"It is too soon to say whether a cup of coffee is anything more than a pleasant pick me up.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBookmark with: Delicious\\n\\nDigg\\n\\nreddit\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nStumbleUpon What are these?

              " 'The Stack Archive\\n\\nThai government to track foreigners using SIM cards\\n\\nTue 9 Aug 2016\\n\\nThe government of Thailand will hold a special session to review a plan to track foreigners in Thailand using SIM cards. The plan, announced last week to track tourists, has been expanded to cover anyone in Thailand who does not hold a Thai passport.\\n\\nThe plan would require any person in Thailand without a Thai passport to turn on location trackers for any Thai-purchased SIM card. There would be no distinction between foreigners traveling as tourists and long-term resident aliens holding visas for education, employment or marriage.\\n\\nTourists visiting Thailand with SIM cards from their home countries using roaming services would not be required to replace their existing SIM with a Thai-issued location tracking version. However, if they wish to purchase a SIM card from a Thai provider using a foreign ID or passport, they would be required to turn on location services.\\n\\nSecretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), Thailand, Takorn Tantasith, said, “We will separate SIM cards for foreigners and Thais. The location will always be turned on in this SIM card for foreigners. And it cannot be turned off.”\\n\\nThis move is being touted as a national security measure and an innovation that would help tackle trans-border crime, rather than a violation of personal privacy. It is expected to be rolled out in the next six months.\\n\\nSimilar programs in Malaysia and Singapore require registration of SIM cards, but do not require that location services be turned on and available to government authorities. However, following an international meeting of telecommunications regulators from 10 countries in Phuket last week, Takorn claims that Malaysia and Singapore plan to follow suit.\\n\\nWhile the plan raises concerns regarding surveillance and privacy, Takorn was quick to note that only governmental authorities would have the ability to track foreigners through their SIM cards.\\n\\n“We would just facilitate the police. So they could more easily track foreigners who enter the country and commit crimes,” he said, adding that Thai citizens can already be easily tracked by the government. Further, he said, any abuse of the system would be punished. “If a service provider tracks the SIM location without a court order, they would be charged with a criminal offense.”\\n\\nTags:\\n\\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.',\n",

Under the Gun will be on view Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays through February 4, 2017.\\n\\n“We’ve had wonderful support from city officials, the arts community, faith leaders and more, and we have some good programming in place,” said Rohrs. “Why can’t Norfolk be on the forefront of reducing gun violence in all forms?

              " 'A couple of weeks ago, I noted that the CIA Memorandum for the Record from their February 4, 2003 briefing of Pat Roberts revealed that Bob Graham, Roberts’ predecessor as Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, had attempted to institute some oversight over the CIA’s interrogation program in November 2002. After CIA discouraged the idea in the briefing, Roberts immediately backed off the idea of doing any oversight.\\n\\nRoberts’ [redacted; staffer?] asked me whether I had “taken up the line” the Committee’s, actually Senator Graham’s, late November request to undertake its own “assessment” of the enhanced interrogation. I [Stan Moskowitz, head of Congressional Affairs] explained to Senator Roberts the dialogue I had had with [redacted], and our responce [sic] that we would not support reading another staffer into the program nor allow any staffer to review the interrogations in real time or visit the clandestine site where the interrogations were taking place. Quickly, the Senator interjected that he saw no reason for the Committee to pursue such a request and could think of “ten reasons right off why it is a terrible idea” for the Committee to do any such thing as had been proposed. Turning to [redacted], he asked whether they thought otherwise and they indicated that they agreed with the Senator.\\n\\nI wanted to know what kind of oversight Graham had had in mind, so I asked Senator Graham for an explanation of the reference. According to Graham, a majority of Committee members in November 2002–including a few Republicans–supported conducting oversight of the program. And it seems that CIA mischaracterized to Roberts what Graham had planned, perhaps in an effort to dissuade Roberts from conducting that oversight.\\n\\nGraham reminded me (as I reported last May) that he was never briefed on the abusive techniques the CIA was using. So he didn’t decide to do more oversight of the program because of concerns about the techniques.\\n\\nRather, there was “a lot of smoke” that made it clear “something out of the norm was occurring.” There were “rumors that something was occurring out of the ordinary.” (I asked specifically whether he had heard any rumors about the November 2002 Salt Pit death, but he said he had not.)\\n\\nBut contrary to what the CIA represented to Roberts, Graham wasn’t asking to “review the interrogations in real time.” He was planning initial oversight of the interrogation program. He wanted to ask basic questions about what was going on:\\n\\nWhat’s going on?\\n\\nWho authorized the program?\\n\\nWhat [intelligence] are we getting out of it?\\n\\nGraham told me that “well over a majority” of the committee supported doing such oversight. When I asked, he said Jay Rockefeller, who replaced him as the Ranking Democrat on the Committee, supported the effort. Though Graham didn’t remember precisely who was on the Committee at the time (here’s the list), he named Richard Lugar and Mike DeWine as two of the Republicans who were probably in the majority supporting this kind of oversight over the program.\\n\\nBut between CIA’s apparent misrepresentations to Roberts and Roberts’ own disinterest in asking even the most basic questions about the CIA’s interrogation programs, those efforts ended when Graham left the committee and Roberts took over as Chair.\\n\\nAnd that’s how Pat Roberts and CIA agreed to avoid asking or answering even the most basic questions about the Bush Administration’s torture program.',\n",

Oona, his fourth wife, and their eight children had buried him in a quiet cemetery by their home.\\n\\nThat was what the police were calling about.\\n\\n\"They said, look, somebody dug up the grave and he\\'s gone,” Chaplin’s son, Eugene, later recalled to the Independent.\\n\\nThat was the beginning of one of the most spectacularly unsuccessful body snatchings in history. The thieves soon called the home with their terms. They wanted the equivalent of about $600,000 for the safe return of Chaplin’s body and threatened the lives of the couple’s young children should their demands not be met.\\n\\nOona would have nothing to do with it. \"Charlie would have thought it rather ridiculous,\" she said, according to Mental Floss.\\n\\nBut the body-snatchers were desperate and the local police diligent. In May of that year, expecting another call from the crooks, police had Oona’s phone tapped and every one of the area’s 200 phone booths monitored by detectives. The efforts paid out, and two mechanics and political refugees from Eastern Europe, Roman Wardas and Gantscho Ganev, were finally nabbed.\\n\\nAfter the two led the authorities to the cornfield where they had temporarily re-buried Chaplin, they were prosecuted for grave robbing and attempted extortion. Wardas, the reported \"mastermind,\" was sentenced to four years, while Ganev got an 18-month suspended sentence.\\n\\nBoth appeared somewhat sorry for their crimes. Eugene told the Independent that both graverobbers wrote letters to his mother, who was ready to let bygones be bygones. \"The wife of the nicer one wrote and said \\'We\\'re so sorry\\'. My mother wrote back and said: \\'Look, all is forgiven.\\'\"\\n\\nAs for poor Charlie, he was reburied in his original plot. This time, however, the family opted for a concrete coating over the grave to deter any future robberies. Though a 2014 French film on the ordeal called The Price of Fame reawakened interest in the case, for the last four decades, as far as anyone knows, the comedian has been resting quietly in peace.',\n",
              " 'Germans Are Drinking Less Beer These Days, But Why?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Johannes Simon/Getty Images Johannes Simon/Getty Images\\n\\nFor centuries, Germany has been synonymous with beer. Tourists flock from around the world to take part in the country\\'s many beer festivals, including the famous Oktoberfest.\\n\\nBut officials say the German beer tradition is waning. A recent government report found Germans drink less beer now than they did a generation ago. To find out why, I visited some pubs and brew experts in Berlin — and heard a range of explanations.\\n\\nAt the Max and Moritz tavern, in a former working-class neighborhood of the German capital, beer once flowed as freely as the nearby Spree River. The pub is named after the characters of a beloved children\\'s tale whose images adorn the walls and shelves, but it\\'s the beer that this tavern is famous for.\\n\\nAs in most traditional German pubs, local brews are served here from taps or in bottles. On the night I visited, most customers were drinking wine or soda pop.\\n\\nOne of those drinking a soda was my husband\\'s friend, Jan Katzmarczyk, a German lawyer who has sworn off alcohol for Lent. Even when he does drink, the 41-year-old says, he rarely orders a beer anymore — maybe two a week, but not more.\\n\\nHe took us to several well-known pubs in Berlin to see what his country\\'s statistics agency is reporting: that Germans — despite consuming 2 1/2 billion gallons of beer last year — are drinking less beer now than at any time since 1990.\\n\\n\"People might drink less because it has lots of calories,\" Katzmarczyk says. \"People are thinking much about their bellies, and beer is not helping.\"\\n\\nAt a nearby tavern called Zur Kleinen Markthalle, or \"small market hall,\" there were more beer drinkers. But bartender Andreas Varrelman confirmed what the government is reporting: Fewer patrons order beer these days.\\n\\nHe blamed the decrease on Germany\\'s economic crisis, saying he thinks people are more reluctant to go out and spend money, including on beer.\\n\\nMarc-Oliver Huhnholz, spokesman for the German Brewers Association, says the waning interest in beer is more about changes to German society.\\n\\n\"We have a shift of the population — the people become older and less younger are following,\" he says. That means there are fewer Germans in younger age groups, which are more typically associated with beer-drinking.\\n\\nGermans are drinking less beer now than at any time since 1990.\"\\n\\nHuhnholz adds that there are also fewer jobs in fields once associated with drinking beer, like mining and construction. \"When the people have built a house or something like this, they opened the first bottle at 8 o\\'clock in the morning,\" he says. \"Now we have computer work, we have much more mobility, so people are driving cars.\"\\n\\nAnd that means less drinking of alcohol, be it beer or anything else.\\n\\nDespite the decrease, Huhnholz notes that Germany is still among the top three beer-drinking countries in Europe. The 28 gallons of beer per capita Germans consume every year far exceeds what Americans drink — 21 gallons per capita.\\n\\nTo lure more Germans back to beer-drinking, Huhnholz\\'s brewers are experimenting with new products, including tasty nonalcoholic beers and fruit-flavored beers, as well as unusual mixes, like beer with cappuccino.',\n",
              " 'Internment is the imprisonment of people, commonly in large groups, without charges[1] or intent to file charges,[2] and thus no trial. The term is especially used for the confinement \"of enemy citizens in wartime or of terrorism suspects\".[3] Thus, while it can simply mean imprisonment, it tends to refer to preventive confinement, rather than confinement after having been convicted of some crime. Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities.[4]\\n\\nInterned persons may be held in prisons or in facilities known as internment camps. In certain contexts, these may also be known either officially or pejoratively, as concentration camps.\\n\\nInternment also refers to a neutral country\\'s practice of detaining belligerent armed forces and equipment on its territory during times of war under the Hague Convention of 1907.[5]\\n\\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights restricts the use of internment. Article 9 states that \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\"[6]\\n\\nDefining internship and \"concentration camp\" [ edit ]\\n\\nThe American Heritage Dictionary defines the term concentration camp as: \"A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions, often as a result of their membership in a group the government has identified as dangerous or undesirable.\"[7]\\n\\nAlthough the first example of civilian internment may date as far back as the 1830s[8], the English term concentration camp was first used in order to refer to the reconcentrados (reconcentration camps) set up by the Spanish military in Cuba during the Ten Years\\' War (1868–78).[9] The term saw wider use around the Second Boer War (1899–1902), when the British operated such camps in South Africa for interning Boers.[9][10]\\n\\nDuring and after the American Civil War, concentration camps located in Natchez, Mississippi were used to corral freed slaves. \"As slaves were being emancipated from the plantations, their route to freedom usually took them in the vicinity of the Union army forces. Unhappy with the slaves being freed, the army began recapturing the slaves and forced the men back into hard labor camps. The most notorious of the several concentration camps that were established was located in Natchez, MS.\"[11]\\n\\nDuring the 20th century, the arbitrary internment of civilians by the state reached its most extreme form with the establishment of the Nazi concentration camps (1933–45). The Nazi concentration camp system was extensive, with as many as 15,000 camps[12] and at least 715,000 simultaneous internees.[13] The total number of casualties in these camps is difficult to determine, but the conscious policy of extermination through labor in at least some of the camps ensured that the inmates would die of starvation, untreated disease and summary executions.[14] Moreover, Nazi Germany established six extermination camps, specifically designed to kill millions, primarily by gassing.[15][16]\\n\\nAs a result, the term \"concentration camp\" today is sometimes conflated with the concept of \"extermination camp\" and historians debate whether the term \"concentration camp\" or \"internment camp\" should be used to describe other examples of civilian internment.[4]\\n\\nSee also [ edit ]\\n\\nReferences [ edit ]',\n",
              " '\\n\\nMason Raymond in his natural habitat.\\n\\nSo Mason Raymond re-signed today, and a fanbase went nuts. But you all know the story. Thom linked to it earlier.\\n\\nAnyway, I don’t think that fans in the Vancouver market truly appreciate shooter regression. Raymond shot at just 8% last season and 7.6% the season before that. Now, there’s reason to believe that “Raymond is just a horrible shooter” but like I showed with my Jason Garrison analysis, even four years doesn’t generally predict how good of a shooter a player is.\\n\\nSo I took the simple route. I looked at five forwards who had a shooting percentage similar to Raymond’s last year from the year 2011. I wanted to compare it with how they did in 2012. Small sample, whatever. Raymond is a small sample himself, and all we want is a general idea of what we can expect out of Raymond.\\n\\nMy five players:\\n\\nRadim Vrbata Patric Hornqvist Matt Hendricks Jannik Hansen Matt Cullen\\n\\nHow did those players do in 2011?\\n\\nGoals/82 Shots/Game Sh% Vrbata 19.7 3.04 7.92% Hornqvist 21.8 3.35 7.92% Hendricks 9.6 1.47 7.96% Hansen 9.0 1.38 7.96% Cullen 12.6 1.92 8.00% All 14.5 2.23 7.95%\\n\\nSo, not too different from Mason Raymond. As a trivial exercise, Raymond had 14.9 goals per 82 games, 2.27 shots per game and a shooting percentage of exactly 8.0%. So he’s pretty much identical to these combined players.\\n\\nHow did those players do the very next season?\\n\\nGoals/82 Shots/Game Sh% Vrbata 37.3 3.01 15.09% Hornqvist 29.1 3.03 11.74% Hendricks 4.2 1.24 4.12% Hansen 16.0 1.67 11.68% Cullen 15.7 2.25 8.54% All 20.4 2.23 11.16%\\n\\nFunny. Shots per game was exactly equal, yet the player’s scored more goals. Why? Because they got a couple more bounces apiece. Vrbata and Hornqvist each had career years. Hansen developed into a strong two-way threat. Even with Hendricks’ offensive meltdown, every other player increased their production.\\n\\nFor the record, Mason Raymond is not as bad as Matt Hendricks.',\n",

That has to be inquired into.\\'\\n\\nDeputy Murphy also said the other bidders had indicated they were prepared to pay more. She said that Altrad, who were a trader buyer who were excluded from the bidding process, had stated that 60m was their opening bid.\\n\\nShe also raised the share activity saying that at the start of November 2011, the share price was 3.5 cent but over the course of the month as the supposed confidential process intensifies, the purchases of Siteserv shares increase 53 fold.\\n\\nShe said the review announced cannot be considered independent no matter how much you stretch the imagination.\\n\\n\\'They led the sale, they represented the interests of many key players and Kieran Wallace himself led the liquidation of Siteserve plc\\'.\\n\\nEarlier, Fianna Fáil Deputy Sean Fleming accused Mr Noonan of \"being asleep at the wheel\" while the Siteserv deal was going on.\\n\\nDeputy Fleming said the special liquidator\\'s report would be tainted.\\n\\nHe said there was a bit of the Bart Simpson about the Minister, he knew nothing, nobody told him. 1817\\n\\nFianna Fáil Deputy Timmy Dooley questioned why the Siteserv loan was not put up for sale.\\n\\nParty leader leader Micheál Martin put it to the minister that there was no logical reason to exclude trade buyers and that higher bids were excluded.\\n\\nHe said that Blackstone was hired without competitive tender and said the company had made millions.\\n\\nDeputy Martin said ramming through the review showed the \"arrogant and detached mentality\" of the Government.\\'\\n\\nHe said it was a fundamental error of judgement and described it as a \"stitch up\" to get the outcome the Government wants.',\n",

              " 'Several members of the Hmong community said they\\'re living in fear, after two traumatic incidents right here in northcentral Wisconsin.\\n\\nOne Hmong family in Junction City has now relocated fearing their safety. This comes after their neighbor shot toward them earlier this month. When arrested, the 80-year-old Junction City man, Henry Kaminski, told an officer he felt there were too many Hmong people in the area.\\n\\nNow, Democratic Representative Katrina Shankland is speaking out, asking residents to treat the Hmong community with respect. This comes not only after the Junction City incident, but also after she received an anonymous letter this week asking to \"deport all Hmong\\'s.\\'\\'\\n\\nThe letter caused fear for some Hmong residents in Portage County. People like Chai Moua of the Hmong American Association.\\n\\n\"It really sunk into me that if there was one person who could think this way, and can come out like this,\" Moua said. \"How many more are waiting to cause harm?

Shankland said it\\'s a topic that needs to be heard.\\n\\n\"I think here in Portage County we don\\'t talk about race very much probably because we\\'re a predominately white county,\" Shankland said. \"But the Hmong people deserve to have an equal voice and equal recognition in our community.\"\\n\\nSomething former President of Portage County\\'s Hmong American Association Soua Cheng believes.\\n\\n\"We are part of this community.

              " 'Lance Stephenson is coming off what many would refer to as a career year with the Indiana Pacers. Sadly, that isn’t saying much as it was the first time in three seasons that Stephenson received legitimate playing time. He had a great season, but 2013-14 is going to be even better.\\n\\nStephenson averaged 8.8 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists in 29.2 minutes per game last year. Measly numbers when you really think about it, however, it’s feasible to think he could surpass those numbers, minus the minutes played, this season even while coming off the bench.\\n\\nHe earned a spot in the starting rotation last season when Danny Granger went down with a knee injury during the preseason. He went on to accumulate 2,278 minutes on the court, nearly five times the amount of minutes he played his first two seasons in the league. That number will dwindle a tad, but he will still close in on 2,000 minutes. Every minute will be beneficial to Stephenson as he will need to continue to grow more comfortable on the court.\\n\\nBut Stephenson isn’t without his flaws. One area he really needs to work on is his shooting. He shot 46 percent last season, which isn’t terrible, but only 33 percent from three-point range, a shot he chose more often than not. An asset Stephenson failed to take advantage of last season was his speed. While he would use his speed during a fast break, once it broke down he would more often than not settle for a three-pointer instead of trying to take his man one-on-one. He will need to work on this if he expects to become a starter again in the NBA.\\n\\nIt was easy to give him a pass last season when he jacked up unnecessary shots or made boneheaded plays, but that all changes this year. A lot more will be expected from Stephenson, especially if he is the leader of the second unit. He can’t play haphazardly anymore. While he ranked only fifth on the Pacers in turnovers per game with 1.4, he also had just 10 more assists than David West. Don’t get me wrong, West is an amazing passer for a power forward, but Stephenson’s style of play leaves him open to throwing too many erratic passes.\\n\\nFor the Pacers to continue to succeed, Stephenson will need to play like a starter, not a bench player. The worst case scenario would be Stephenson coming down with “Hansbrough Syndrome” and not being able to handle playing off the bench after getting a significant amount of starts. From all accounts it doesn’t appear Stephenson will mind coming off the bench, but that’s easier said than done.\\n\\nStephenson is also in a contract year, which means he is playing for not only his next contract, but possibly a new suitor. Teams will be gunning to break up the Pacers if they continue to excel, and an easy target will be Stephenson. This is also a good thing for the Pacers because Lance knows he will have to perform better than last year if he wants a big payday, which means they will benefit this year from his improvements.\\n\\nLance Stephenson brings a different style of play to this Pacers team, one that is fun and exciting to watch, but he can also scare you at times. He will be able to work on reigning in his game this season, all while trying to win a championship and proving he belongs in any team’s starting lineup.\\n\\nMathew Muncy is an Indiana Pacers writer for RantSports.com.

The ASO website provides a Q&A section, which details the situation and its impact.\\n\\nThe ASO has been operating with a deficit for the past 12 years.\\n\\nWhile the two parties could not agree on the terms of the new contract, they do agree that a lack of public arts funding is a factor contributing to the nationwide trend of financial woes for symphonies and opera companies.\\n\\nMayor of Atlanta, Kasim Reed said in a statement on Thursday that he urged both sides to return to the bargaining table, realizing that the ASO’s financial solvency and musical excellence are intertwined, not opposing forces.”\\n\\n“A protracted lockout is not good for the ASO and not good for Atlanta,” he said.\\n\\nGeorgia’s arts funding is about 6 cents per capita compared to the national average of 87 cents. The state occupies the 50th position on the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies (NASAA) funding list. On its website, the ASO claims that this lack of funding is exacerbating its financial challenges.\\n\\nAmong the musicians rising up in solidarity with Atlanta Symphony musicians on the web and over social media are the Minnesota Orchestra Musicians, who endured a 16-month lockout in 2010-2011 and the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra Musicians, whose members were locked out of the Hilbert Circle Theatre for one month in 2012.\\n\\nMusicians of the New York Philharmonic sent $10,000 to ASO musicians to show their support and New York’s MET Orchestra Musicians, who voted to authorize a strike in May of this year when it looked like contract negotiations would fall apart ahead of the July 31 expiration date, posted “How You Can Help the ATL Symphony“.\\n\\nThe musicians’ union and ASO management will return to the bargaining table with the help of a federal mediator – the same mediator who handled the Metropolitan Opera negotiations in August – according to a Sept. 27 post on the ASO Facebook page.',\n",
              " \"says himself, there are two jobs in the world where you cannot lie to your customer. One is a doctor. The other is a bartender. A doctor will do his best to heal his customer's body, and a bartender will do his best to heal his customer's soul. Ryuu Sasakura shows incredible skills at figuring people out and what is going in their head, as he then manage to heal their worries or troubles with a drink and a lesson hidden within his very cocktails. Not only that but I also guarantee you that you'll learn a lot about alcohols too.Art :The art is just incredible. Not only is it well drawn, but it is drawn in a way that puts the right ambiance at the right moment increasing the strength of the emotions the characters are trying to make us, reader, feel about their situation. It is rather soothing and refreshing with a great attention to details too.Character :Probably, no, most likely Bartender's strongest point. The main characters are very well written and easy to like. But it also has a strong cast of other characters in each chapter, some of them who return later and some of them who we will see only once. But it doesn't stop them from being just as well made as the main characters. Each of them has a past, a personality that was worked on. They just don't get more character development but at the very least you'll remember them for who they were and they leave an impression. And it doesn't stop there. The way they interact with each other, especially with Ryuu Sasakura, the main character, leads to multiple interesting situations. It is a shame, truly, that it is hard for me to make justice to the way characters interact with each other, I just hope I could explain it better but it has to be read.Enjoyment :I knew a little bit about alcohols, just a bit and I wasn't particularly interested in that but I liked the things I learned, it was rather entertaining on its own, but the manga as a whole with the characters, the story and all, truly a masterpiece. Those who only like action based manga will probably fall asleep on it, but for those who prefer a more soothing and calm manga where words count more than how many sword hits one can do in a second, I highly suggest this manga. It has its share of funny moments too, don't forget about it, but really, the thing that I liked the more about it is just how easy I could go and read it without stopping or being able to notice the time pass.Final words :Give it a try, trust me, you will not regret it.\",\n",
              " 'Men have one copy, women have two, but scientists have long puzzled over why the human X chromosome mostly contains genes that are active in a small number of tissues. Now, a team of researchers led by the University of Bath studying the evolution of this X chromosome has discovered why it contains such an unusual mixture of genes.\\n\\nIn humans, males have XY chromosomes, females have XX but only one of these is active, meaning that both sexes only have one active copy of the X chromosome.\\n\\nScientists discovered in 2002 that the X chromosome is unusual because it contains very few of the most important genes needed for basic cell function -- dubbed \"housekeeping\" genes.\\n\\nNow the team, a collaboration between researchers at the University of Bath and Uppsala University, along with members of the FANTOM consortium, have found out why.\\n\\nThey analysed the world\\'s largest compendium of data on gene activity (expression) and looked at how activity on the X chromosome compares with that on other chromosomes.\\n\\nIn a paper published in the journal PLoS Biology, they found that the peak level of gene expression on the X chromosome was under half that of other chromosomes where we have two functioning copies.\\n\\nThe study was led by Professor Laurence Hurst, Director of the Milner Centre for Evolution based in the Department of Biology & Biochemistry at the University of Bath.\\n\\nHe explained: \"Since we showed that X-linked genes tend to be relatively tissue specific over a decade ago, the reason as to why the X chromosome is so odd has bugged me.\\n\\n\"In the end, we have found the answer to be quite simple. Whereas most chromosomes operate in pairs, meaning there are two copies of each gene in every cell, in contrast, we only have one active copy of the X chromosome.\\n\\n\"This means it is not sustainable for highly active genes to be on the X chromosome. Housekeeping genes tend also to be highly active -- they just couldn\\'t survive on the X.\"\\n\\nThe team also identified which genes have moved from the X to the other chromosomes over evolutionary time and those that have gone the other way.\\n\\nThey found that those genes that have migrated onto the X chromosome have much lower peak rates of expression that those making the reverse trip.\\n\\nHurst explained: \"It\\'s a bit like traffic on a busy road -- a highway with two lanes can have a lot more and faster traffic on it than a single lane highway.\\n\\n\"A consequence of having a single chromosome is that, like a one lane road, there will be gene expression traffic tailbacks on the X chromosome especially at peak periods. Hence our X chromosome will not be a tolerable home for the most highly expressed genes.\"\\n\\nThe study also found that, unlike those found on other chromosomes, the more highly expressed genes on the X chromosome were less prone to increasing their expression level over evolutionary time.\\n\\nSenior author Lukasz Huminiecki of Uppsala University commented: \"This fits with our traffic analogy as, if there is a tailback, it is hard to increase the speed of the cars on the road.\"\\n\\nThe team also found that there has been an evolutionary exodus of genes that are highly expressed at peak times from the X chromosome, suggesting these genes cannot function on this chromosome due to the fact there is only one active copy. For example, genes that are active in tissues such as the pancreas which secretes a large number of protein hormones, are noticeably rare on the X chromosome compared to the non-sex chromosomes.\\n\\nHuminiecki added: \"With the remarkable resolution of the FANTOM gene expression data, we have shown that none of the prior explanations resolves fully the mysteries of the X. For example, if you exclude genes expressed in tissues that are found in only one sex or are involved in making sperm, the remainder still have relatively tissue-specific activity.\"\\n\\nThe work has implications for new medical treatments such as gene therapy as it suggests that replacement genes should not be inserted into the X chromosome because traffic tailbacks may limit the extent to which the gene can be expressed.',\n",
              " \"How a candidate of Romney's pedigree could cut such an unsympathetic figure has become a minor obsession in the media. Explanations range from his association with the corporate one percent to his willingness to contradict himself on key issues. All these are true, but the underlying dynamic governing our reaction to his controversial affiliations and positions is a completely natural psychological response to competing stimuli -- one that's best summed up with a technological metaphor.\\n\\nIn robotics, researchers have observed that as an object acquires human-like properties, people respond to the object with more positive feelings. The less anthropomorphized an object, the less empathy. What's cognitively demanding about this formulation is that engineers are beginning to create robots that approximate human behavior so closely that the mind interprets the robot in human terms even if the machine lacks distinguishing anthropomorphic features, like a face. The result is an unsettling feeling that borders on anxiety or revulsion. When a robot inspires such emotions, it's said to have fallen into the uncanny valley of a conceptual graph that charts fluctuations in our empathetic capacity. The graph in question looks something like this:\\n\\nOn one end of the graph, objects that look nothing like humans elicit a minimum of empathy. On the other end are real humans, with whom we identify most. In between are things that resemble humans to some degree and earn some measure of recognition for it. In the case of objects falling into the uncanny valley, the recognition can actually be negative. They recall humanity, inviting us to empathize as we might with a real human, but imperfections in the illusion create a kind of dissonance that makes us uncomfortable.\\n\\nRomney's problem is that he occupies a kind of uncanny valley for politicians. Just as people who interact with lifelike robots often develop a strange feeling due to something they can't quite name, something about Romney leaves voters unsettled.\\n\\nAs with the robotic version of the uncanny valley, the closer Romney gets to becoming real to a voter, the more his likeability declines. On television and at a distance, the former governor radiates presidential qualities from every patrician pore. The effect is almost involuntary, considering the substantial advantages Romney enjoys from appearance alone. But in person, his polished persona gives way to what appears a surprisingly forced and inauthentic character. What's disturbing about episodes like those detailed in this story isn't that they happen -- it's that they're inexplicably happening to a man who should, by the looks of him, navigate the political waters with ease.\\n\\nMost politicians tend to be ordinary-looking people who spend their time convincing voters they're office-quality material. Romney is rushing the other way: he's the politician from central casting who is stumbling through an audition for a role of regular human. Not that other candidates don't make mistakes -- they do, all the time -- but in Romney's case awkward moments stand out like neon road signs precisely because we expect him to make the jump from TV to reality as effortlessly and convincingly as his polished appearance would imply.\\n\\nRomney's task now is to work his way out of the uncanny valley toward a more compelling style of humanity. But every day he lingers in it, the hill grows steeper.\\n\\nImage credit: Wikimedia Commons\\n\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

              " 'You’ve probably seen the headlines announcing that by 2020 the United States will pass Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest oil producer, and that by 2030 North America will be a net exporter of oil. The International Energy Agency, representing 28 of the world’s richest countries, comes to that conclusion in its annual report, World Energy Outlook 2012. Most of that expansion will come from non-traditional sources — especially shale oil and tar sands.\\n\\nLorne Stockman of Oil Change International draws our attention to another of the report’s conclusions, one that hasn’t been widely reported. The IEA notes that with every passing year it is harder to believe that average global warming can be kept below 2°C – the level at which scientists say catastrophic climate change will become avoidable. And it says:\\n\\n“No more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2°C goal.”\\n\\nThat’s not the opinion of some flaky tree-hugger. It’s the considered judgment of the world’s leading authorities on energy. If we don’t leave at least two-thirds of oil in the soil, the climate will boil.\\n\\nHow is the industry responding to this?\\n\\nStockman points out that the Alberta Tar Sands alone has enough projects producing, under construction and approved “to blow well past the climate limits prescribed by the IEA.” What’s more, the oil industry has still more tar sands projects waiting regulatory decisions, “leading to a possible trebling of production capacity over and above the IEA limit.”\\n\\nIn other words, no matter what happens elsewhere, if we don’t shut down the Alberta Tar Sands, the world is cooked.\\n\\n———\\n\\nIan\\n\\nMore from my notebook',\n",

These three countries have assured India at the highest level that it will abide with the Indian proposal to build energy networks.\\n\\nSimultaneously, there has also been positive signs of giving greater participation to Indian companies in Myanmar and Bangladesh’s energy sector. The way India has tried to improve bilateral relations at all levels with Myanmar and Bangladesh for the past few years, these countries are now ready to open their markets more Indian companies to do business. The Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan has visited Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal recently.\\n\\nOne of the major features of this network will be that every member country will be able to supply and fulfil the energy requirements of other participating nations. Its length will be approximately 7000 km and it will pass through Myanmar’s Sittwe (in the state of Rakhine) and Chittagong of Bangladesh besides most of the North Eastern states of India. To make this network a success, India wants a big stake in energy stores in Myanmar and Bangladesh.\\n\\nAccording to sources in the Ministry of Petroleum, the government of Bangladesh is soon going to block the private sector for exploration and excavation. These blocks are located in the most difficult areas of Bangladesh with petroleum reserves. Indian government company ONGC (Foreign) has bought two key blocks in Bangladesh in 2014 and is doing a good investment there. According to the sources, India has been given a high-level assurance in Bangladesh that the Indian companies will be given full support for this project. It was agreed that during the visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India in April 2017, that the Indian companies will invest $ 9 billion in the energy sector in Bangladesh.\\n\\nOn behalf of Bangladesh, India has been trying to get a share in the huge energy reserves of Myanmar for a long time. Due to China’s domination, India for a long time did not have massive success there, which might see a change now. During the visit of PM Narendra Modi to Myanmar earlier this month, there has been a lot of important talk about the energy sector.

It makes you lose your appetite.”\\n\\nIn scenes reminiscent of the 1980s, one man picked through the garbage, rewarding himself with a half-eaten slice of pizza and a bag of nuts. A woman snored loudly as she slept, sitting upright on a concourse bench.

Sometimes, they accept. Sometimes, they don’t. Most of them don’t want to be bothered.”\\n\\nHarold Nelson, 58, counts himself among the latter category.

He was the first MLS Homegrown player to sign for a European club, and his transfer deal to Anderlecht included a “sell-on clause,” meaning United will claim a percentage of any future transfer of Najar by Anderlecht.\\n\\nNajar appeared in 25 matches in his first season in Belgium and has appeared in eight more this season, scoring two goals. He also appeared in two matches for Honduras during the World Cup this summer in Brazil.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe spent four seasons in MLS and won the league’s Rookie of the Year award in 2010.\\n\\nNajar has also recently been linked to clubs in Spain as well as EPL sides Arsenal and Newcastle. He has history with Tottenham – he spent two weeks training with the club in 2011 and later said “those two weeks allowed me to experience European football and helped ease my transition to Anderlecht” – and Spurs have a history inking former and current MLS players.\\n\\nLongtime United States national team goalkeeper Brad Friedel has been with the club since 2011, Clint Dempsey played there in 2012-13 and Seattle Sounders defender DeAndre Yedlin signed with Spurs earlier this year with expectations that he will join the club sometime ahead of the 2015-16 season.',\n",
              " 'Remember the star of Windy City Heat? Wondering what he’s been up to? His publicist/agent Tom (the best in the business) is here to keep you up to speed. –\\n\\n–\\n\\nPerry is the most unique client I have ever worked with. Even as I type these words, I feel that I’m failing to convey just how challenging representing the man can be. As Perry’s publicist/agent, it’s tremendously challenging to work with someone who’s presently in the system. Of course Perry will be the first to admit that he’s the sole person responsible for putting himself there, but that doesn’t alleviate the considerable challenges we are presented with. How does one represent a client that can’t actually get work?\\n\\nThe answer lies within the “F-word,” and by that, I of course mean faith. My faith in Perry is what keeps me going. I have been asked many times by my colleagues how I can possibly work pro bono for guy that offers so many challenges within the industry. My answer has always been, “I have faith in Perry Caravello.” I have faith that Perry will one day get out of the system, make reparations for his previous misdeeds and become the star that he was always destined to be. However, Perry cannot do this on his own. He has dug himself a rather deep ditch and he’ll need a rope to get himself out. Will he use that rope to pull himself up or will he simply hang himself with it (metaphorically speaking of course)? Time will tell.\\n\\nPerry ran into some problems on Facebook back in February and had to shut things down for a while. First Perry became a proud supporter of N.A.M.B.L.A. (North American Man Boy Love Association) when he proclaimed his love for the notorious group that advocates pedophilia. Perry went as far as posting photos of stickers from the group that were affixed to his car and truck. Supporting this despicable group was of course a very bad decision, though to be fair, Perry was told the group stood for Negative Allegations Made By Legendary Actors. Being a legendary actor himself, Perry was honored with the affiliation.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, Perry made another poor decision when he decided to unleash everyone that was on his blocked list on Facebook. Many of whom were bad people who did not have Perry’s best interest at heart. Within one hour of being freed from the confines of Perry’s blocked list, one such individual took control of Perry’s account. Claiming to be a voice from Perry’s past, this person assumed Perry’s identity and made some wild accusations. Thankfully, the account was eventually restored thanks to help of Don Barris, who had also informed Perry of the true meaning of N.A.M.B.L.A.\\n\\nFor now, Perry has been laying low and trying to keep out of trouble.He’s also been spending hours upon hours watching various television shows. He’s currently obsessed with both “New Girl” and “Breaking Bad.” Perry Caravello is a man who likes to bathe himself in great acting, so he feels the combination of Zooey Deschanel and Bryan Cranston will help him dust off his own acting chops. Those chops will be more than ready to strike when the time comes. Yes, I have faith.\\n\\nBut enough from me, let’s hear from the man himself. I asked Perry if he would be kind enough to write down what he’s been up to over the past couple of months and he generously took the time to shoot this video.\\n\\n-TOM BRENNAN',\n",
              " 'At a remarkable conference held at the Aspen Institute in 2011, General Michael Hayden, a former head of both the NSA and the CIA, said something very interesting. In a discussion of how to secure the \"critical infrastructure\" of the United States he described the phenomenon of compromised computer hardware – namely, chips that have hidden \"back doors\" inserted into them at the design or manufacturing stage – as \"the problem from hell\". And, he went on, \"frankly, it\\'s not a problem that can be solved\".\\n\\nNow General Hayden is an engaging, voluble, likable fellow. He\\'s popular with the hacking crowd because he doesn\\'t talk like a government suit. But sometimes one wonders if his agreeable persona is actually a front for something a bit more disingenuous. Earlier in the Aspen discussion, for example, he talked about the Stuxnet worm – which was used to destroy centrifuges in the Iranian nuclear programme – as something that was obviously created by a nation-state, but affected not to know that the US was one of the nation-states involved.\\n\\nGiven Hayden\\'s background and level of security clearance, it seems inconceivable that he didn\\'t know who built Stuxnet. So already one had begun to take his contributions with a modicum of salt. Nevertheless, his observation about the intractability of the problem of compromised hardware seemed incontrovertible. This is because covertly modified hardware is hard to detect – much more so than dodgy software. The hardware in a computer can do things like access data in ways that are completely invisible even to the machine\\'s security software. At the Black Hat security conference in August last year, for example, a researcher named Jonathan Brossard demonstrated software that can be burned into the hardware of a PC, creating a back door that would allow secret remote access over the internet. And – here\\'s the really scary bit – the secret entrance couldn\\'t even be closed by switching off the computer\\'s hard disk or reinstalling its operating system.\\n\\nThe reason this is so scary is because virtually every bit of kit that runs the internet – the machine on which you compose your emails, the tablet or smartphone with which you browse the net, the routers that pass on the data packets that comprise your email or your web search, everything – is a computer. So the thought that all this stuff might covertly be compromised in ways that are impossible to detect is terrifying. It\\'s this fear that underpins American (and British) reservations about network products made by the Chinese company Huawei – the suspicions (vehemently denied by Huawei, of course) that the kit has secret back doors installed in it to facilitate the Chinese\\'s cyber-army\\'s penetration of western networks.\\n\\nSo Hayden was right: it is a problem from hell. If the hardware that runs the internet has been polluted or infiltrated then we\\'re all screwed, because there\\'s no bit of cyberspace you can trust. And I know, I know: it sounds like paranoia – until you discover that Darpa, the research arm of the US department of defence (DoD), has launched a massive research project into compromised hardware.\\n\\nThe department\\'s growing dependence on the global supply chain, it says, \"makes device, software and firmware security an imperative. Back doors, malicious software and other vulnerabilities unknown to the user could enable an adversary to use a device to accomplish a variety of harmful objectives, including the exfiltration [extraction] of sensitive data and the sabotage of critical operations. Determining the security of every device DoD uses in a timely fashion is beyond current capabilities.\"\\n\\nAt this point we enter a Kafkaesque world of smoke and mirrors. Because one of the most obvious inferences from the Snowden revelations published by the Guardian, New York Times and ProPublica recently is that the NSA has indeed been up to the business of inserting covert back doors in networking and other computing kit.\\n\\nThe reports say that, in addition to undermining all of the mainstream cryptographic software used to protect online commerce, the NSA has been \"collaborating with technology companies in the United States and abroad to build entry points into their products\".\\n\\nThese reports have, needless to say, been strenuously denied by the companies, such as Cisco, that make this networking kit. Perhaps the NSA omitted to tell Darpa what it was up to? In the meantime, I hear that some governments have decided that their embassies should no longer use electronic communications at all, and are returning to employing couriers who travel the world handcuffed to locked dispatch cases. We\\'re back to the future, again.',\n",
              " 'Analysis Of Pirated Oscar Movies Shows They\\'re Almost All Available... In HD (And Not From Screeners)\\n\\nfrom the because-of-course dept\\n\\nBut here’s the thing: screeners are stuck in the last decade. While we’re all streaming HD movies from iTunes or Netflix, the movie studios almost universally send screeners by mail on DVDs, which is forever stuck in low-resolution standard-definition quality. A small handful are sent in higher-definition Blu-ray.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year, one Academy member received 68 screeners — 59 on DVD and only eight on Blu-ray. Only 13% of screeners were sent to voters in HD quality.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a result, virtually any HD source is more prestigious than a DVD screener. And with the shift to online distribution, there’s an increasing supply of possible HD sources to draw from before screeners are ever sent to voters.\\n\\nOf this year’s 36 nominated films, 34 already leaked online in some form — everything except Song of the Sea and Glen Campbell: I’ll Be Me.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut only 33% of those were leaked from screeners, down from a high of 89% in 2003 and 2004.\\n\\nAs we\\'ve mentioned in the past, every year for over a decade, Andy Baio scours the internet to see what Oscar-nominated movies have been put online (the answer is usually almost all of them). He started this back in 2004, when the MPAA laughably claimed that the very first \"screener\" copy of a nominated movie had been put online. Baio realized that it was hardly the first and there were many more. His latest analysis is up and it shows that, yet again, nearly all nominated movies are available. He\\'s actually kept the details of every year\\'s search in a big Google spreadsheet There are some interesting findings in the data, including thatmuch any more. For years, the MPAA -- which still can\\'t get over its piracy obsession -- insisted that screener leaks were a huge problem. Back in 2003 the MPAA wanted to ban screener DVDs entirely , which pissed off a bunch of filmmakers who feared that their films wouldn\\'t get voted on for the Oscars. Since then, they\\'ve focused on ridiculous proprietary systems that would only play on special DVD players -- which just pissed off viewers . In the last few years, they\\'ve just focused on watermarked DVDs, which means that when the videos inevitably leak, they can be tracked back to whose copy leaked -- like Ellen Degeneris\\' copies last year.But, as Baio notes, in the online release market, screener copies aren\\'t good enough:And of course, the data also shows that cammed copies (someone sitting in a theater with a camera filming it) are virtually non-existent here. This is another issue that we\\'ve covered for years, with the MPAA famously making up numbers out of thin air concerning how big a \"problem\" it was. But, of course, the quality on those copies suck, and so people focus on HD, which they inevitably get.As he notes, with the MPAA stupidly focused on screeners, they think they\\'re winning the battle, because here\\'s the percentage of actual screeners leaked:So, I\\'m sure the content protection team at the MPAA are all excited about this. They\\'re vanquishing the screener piracy monster. But as Baio points out, that\\'s bullshit, because just as many films are leaking, but in HD quality from HD sources instead of screeners:While this year\\'s figure is currently 89%, there\\'s a decent chance it will go higher before the Oscars happen. As Baio notes, 44% of the films this year are HD sources, not from screeners or from retail releases.In other words: all this effort from the \"content protection\" team at the MPAA yields absolutely no benefit at all.\\n\\nFiled Under: andy baio, copyright, dvds, hd, movies, oscars, piracy, screeners\\n\\nCompanies: mpaa',\n",

              " 'Monster Hunter 4’s Third Village Is A Peaceful Island Full Of Felynes\\n\\nBy Sato . July 12, 2013 . 1:02am\\n\\nHunters are going to have it pretty rough in Monster Hunter 4, as Capcom recently introduced fearsome enemies such as the giant amphibious shark-like Zaboazagill found at the new Frozen Sea map. Capcom’s next update, however, gives us a look at a new resort-like island as the game’s third village, which looks like the perfect place for beat-up Hunters to take it easy.\\n\\nMonster Hunter 4 will be bringing back the Felyne equipment feature which was available in Monster Hunter Portable 3rd for PSP in Japan. By visiting the blacksmith, you’ll get to make various equipment such as weapons, head gear and body armor for your Felynes. The headgear will give your Felyne characteristic traits on what type of monsters they’ll attack, such as small or large monsters.\\n\\nWe’ve already seen two of Monster Hunter 4’s towns—the trading commerce, Barubare, where many travelers and hunters around the world gather, and Naguri Village, a place that is surrounded by molting lava, ideal for any blacksmith. The third area is called Chico Village, and unlike the previous two, it’s a small and calm area surrounded by the sea.\\n\\nThe village elder is an old lady of the Wyvernian race. She spends her time happily living on the island with Felynes, who call her the “Cat Granny”. Chico Village rarely sees any visitors, and it is said that the only ones living there are the Felynes and the elder.\\n\\nPocaPoca Island is a small island next to Chico Village. This island has many features that are similar to what was available on farms in previous Monster Hunter games.\\n\\nThe manager Felyne will be taking care of you on PocaPoca Island. The Felynes on the island seem troubled by a recent sighting of nearby large monsters, so they’ve been making efforts to find heroic Felynes. Their plan is to make the island a paradise that is flowing with Felynes of all kinds.\\n\\nFor example, you can send out the “Mon Nyan” Felyne crew off on quests and they’ll return with items that are needed to make Felyne equipment. There are three different routes of near, normal and far quest routes, with the further quests being tougher but more rewarding. You’ll need to equip food for them, which has a maximum of three slots and depletes as they go on quests.\\n\\nThe max amount of Felynes you can send on quests is five, and you’ll also have to take their skill types into consideration. For the first time, you’ll actually be participating in the Felyne quests by pressing the touch screen to activate their skills, however, you’ll also have to keep in mind which skills to use, as they can also back fire on you if not used properly.\\n\\nFinally, here’s a look at the new fishing machine that is available on PocaPoca Island. It requires Felynes and stock to use. It may seem easy to use, but it can be quite tricky, as the goal is to aim for an area that has more fish. If the fish move during the last second before you shoot, you’ll end up with a rather poor catch. There are also Felynes who specialize in fishing, making them a great boost for this feature.\\n\\nMonster Hunter 4 will be slated for release on September 14th, for 5,990 yen on Nintendo 3DS.',\n",

              " 'Between now and Opening Day, HardballTalk will take a look at each of baseball’s 30 teams, asking the key questions, the not-so-key questions, and generally breaking down their chances for the 2014 season. First up: The Texas Rangers.\\n\\nThe Big Question: Were the bold moves bold enough?\\n\\nThe past two offseasons seasons saw the division rival Angels make huge additions in Josh Hamilton and Albert Pujols. Those moves didn’t work and, indeed, those moves are cited as part of the reason the Angels have fizzled. Too much star power, not enough depth, they’ve said. It takes more than the big moves to make a contender. So why should the Rangers’ big offseason moves — trading for Prince Fielder and Shin-Soo Choo be any different?\\n\\nBecause they fit a heck of a lot better with the Rangers than those other guys fit with the Angels, that’s why. The Rangers needed on-base ability at the top of the lineup. They needed someone with pop from the left side who can take advantage of the short porch in right down in Arlington. Choo and Fielder supply that in spades. Indeed, Choo is one of baseball’s true on-base machines, and the fact that Jon Daniels and Ron Washington have committed to batting him leadoff is going to mean good things for the lineup. Getting Prince Fielder out of Detroit — and getting him in shape — will do wonders as well. It’ll be hard to find anyone the baseball punditry says will have a better bounceback year than Fielder.\\n\\nYes, the Rangers had to give up Ian Kinsler to snag Fielder, but havung Jurickson Profar move into a regular, everyday role at second base is a nice fallback option. If he plays to his potential, the Rangers could have another star on their hands. If he falters, at least his glove should be solid.\\n\\nUnlike the Angels, the Rangers were not a team trying to patch over several holes with a couple of high-profile signings. They were a strong team who needed a push over the top after falling a couple games short for the AL West title the past two seasons. With Choo and Fielder they should get it.\\n\\nWhat else is going on?\\n\\nInjuries to the rotation are going to go a long way towards determining the Rangers’ fate. Yu Darvish, Matt Harrison and Martin Perez make a nice 1-2-3, but Harrison’s early-spring back issues are worth watching and not having Derek Holland around for the first half of the season due to knee surgery is a big problem. If Harrison is OK and Holland can step in when he’s healthy, the rotation should be OK. If both of those guys are gimpy much of the year Ron Washington is going to lean heavily on Alexi Ogando, Nick Tepesch and Tommy Hanson, and all of those guys are question marks. There’s a lot of depth here, but there’s also a chance that Texas is sporting a rotation with way too many 4-5 guys as the season wears on.\\n\\nThe closer spot could be an all-or-nothing proposition. With Joe Nathan gone we have Neftali Feliz and Joakim Soria vying for ninth inning duties. Both are not too far-removed from dominant pitching and even less far-removed from Tommy John surgery. If one bounces back to his old form, the Rangers have a closer. If both do, they have a two-headed monster in the late innings which could shorten games.\\n\\nA.J. Pierzynski is in Boston, leaving catching duties to Geovany Soto, who has been a backup the past couple of seasons, and J.P. Arencibia, who was one of the worst offensive players in all of baseball last year. Each is capable of so much more than they’ve done recently. It’ll be interesting to see if either of them can regain lost form.\\n\\nRon Washington’s contract was just extended through 2015. Seems like a late and somewhat short vote of confidence compared to how these things usually go for guys with a couple of pennants under their belt. If the Rangers, after taking on Fielder and signing Choo, underachieve this season, it wouldn’t be at all shocking to see Wash on the hot seat.\\n\\nPrediction: That seat shouldn’t be too hot, though. The lineup is stacked. If the rotation doesn’t implode, this is one of the best teams in the AL. First place, AL West.',\n",

              " '\\n\\n\\n\\nTampa, (Fl) --- There are several analysis that can be made to Calvin & Hobbes, from the philosophical traces of Bill Watterson to the use of science as a component of the satire. There is not going to be another Calvin and Hobbes and there is not going to be any spiritual successor of this comic, that has been concluded since 1995.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s amazing that\\'s been almost 20 years since Calvin and Hobbes ended, and the comics strip it is still as fresh as it was on November 18th of 1985. It\\'s quite amazing to think how much the world has changed in the last 29 years. Paris is Still Burning and Jenny Livingston went to make television, AIDS is still a menace, the newer generations are focused on more of the sensual pleasures (not to mention, clicktivism) where they ask for anything without even working; school system keeps failing and becoming more intolerant with everyone...

Probably Calvin is more keen to Generation X, both generations tend to be interrelated on the use of technology and also to be more liberal on certain ideas opposite to the Baby Boomers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalvin and his parents could be seen as both generations living under one roof, but yet the depth of his parents was never explored to know if they were more progressive than they looked on-panel; maybe, Calvin himself could be a reflection of his parents ideals on how to deal with reality and with people, even on an intellectual level.',\n",

Damit ist die zentrale Frage aufgeworfen,\\n\\nwie in einer Einwanderungsgesellschaft gleichberechtigte Teilhabe ermöglicht werden kann\\n\\n. Einen wichtigen\\n\\nSchlüssel für Teilhabe\\n\\nsehen wir, die hier unterzeichnen- den\\n\\nMigrant*innenorganisationen\\n\\nin Deutschland, in der nachhaltigen\\n\\nin- terkulturellen Öffnung\\n\\nder Gesellschaft, ihrer Organisationen und Instituti- onen.

Vielfältige interkulturelle Perspektiven werden von vornherein stärker einbezogen. Dadurch können Zugangsbarrieren für Menschen mit Einwanderungsgeschichte abgebaut und Dienstleistungen diskriminierungsfrei, kultursensibel und effektiver an- geboten werden. Interkulturelle Öffnung bedeutet auch, Rassismus und Diskriminierungen nachdrücklich zu ächten und zu sanktionieren\\n\\n–\\n\\ngerade vor dem Hinter- grund, dass sich das gesellschaftliche Klima rapide verschlechtert. Der Dis- kurs über das Zusammenleben in der Einwanderungsgesellschaft verroht, Gewalt greift um sich. Das Gewaltmonopol des Staates wird zunehmend in Frage gestellt. Eine Mehrheit der Bevölkerung lehnt diese Entwicklung ab, aber zu viele schweigen noch.

But turn the whole world upside down for a few tablets?\"\\n\\nMicrosoft, at least publicly, doesn\\'t seem to agree with these assessments. CEO Steve Ballmer, speaking at the Churchill Club in Santa Clara, Calif., this week, said Windows is off to a spectacular start.\\n\\nRelated stories Microsoft has sold 4 million copies of Windows 8 since launch\\n\\nAnd at Microsoft\\'s Build conference last month, Ballmer boasted that 4 million copies had been sold in the few days since launch on October 26.\\n\\nBut there have been other reports about a lack of interest in upgrading to Windows 8.\\n\\nWhile a general lack of immediate interest in a new operating system is not unusual, based on past Microsoft OS rollouts, the barrier may be higher this time because of the touch-centric interface, particularly at businesses, according to Kay.\\n\\nIndeed, Windows 8 is spurring innovative hybrid designs, such as the HP Envy x2 and the Acer Aspire S7, which combine the traditional clamshell with touch screens. Consumers and businesses may take a while to fully embrace the new paradigm.\\n\\nKay did add that it will take a few months for retail stores to roll over all new PCs to Windows 8. So it won\\'t be until January of next year that Windows 8 is fully represented at retail.\\n\\nAnd sales of the Microsoft Surface tablet seem to be doing OK.

              " 'If you’ve read my book, Zen & The Art Of Disc Golf , you know that I place great emphasis on how having a proper attitude sets the foundation for everything in life and on the course, but If there was one thing I wish I could go back and spend more time is talking about, it is that the fastest way to develop a proper attitude is by adding a gratitude routine to your day.\\n\\nGratitude fuels attitude. When we have a gratitude mindset, the mind starts looking for ways to fulfill vision. Vision is anything we want: a good drive, sinking a putt, a promotion at work, anything!\\n\\nThe opposite of gratitude is thanklessness, and when w are thankless, we are programmed to only see the things we don’t have, can’t do, all sorts of negativity, and our mind becomes programmed in that direction. And where the mind goes, so does the body.\\n\\nI recently read a gratitude routine that I think is probably really effective – use a jar, box, container and put it at your front door with small slivers of paper next to, and everyday before you leave your house take one of the sheets of paper and write down:\\n\\n1. Something you are grateful for.\\n\\n2. Something that you want.\\n\\n3. The actions you will take to get there.\\n\\nSo an example would be:\\n\\n1. I am thankful for all of this excellent plastic in my disc golf bag.\\n\\n2. I would like to sink more 25 foot putts.\\n\\n3.

Ms. Wang confirmed that, as in the past, she and Mr. Liu would be using their American Express card to pay for the Modigliani. That way, with the cardholder’s points they accrue, their whole family — the couple, their four children and two grandchildren — can continue flying for free. “We are on a one-year payment plan for the painting,” Ms. Wang said. “If we had to pay cash upfront, that would be a little difficult for us.” She added: “I mean, who has the money for that?”\\n\\nIndeed!\\n\\nYiqian has done this before: He accrued 422 million points with Amex for buying an ancient ceramic cup last year, according to Bloomberg.

Dragon\\'s success shows that commercial spaceships have the right stuff, and it should pave the way for many more of them to get off the ground in the future, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s a great day for the country and for the world,\" Musk said in a post-docking press conference Friday. \"This really is, I think, going to be recognized as a significantly historical step forward in space travel, and hopefully the first of many to come.\"\\n\\nA big day for NASA, too\\n\\nNASA officials were thrilled with the day\\'s events as well. The space agency is counting on private craft like Dragon to carry cargo, and eventually crew, to the station in the wake of the space shuttle\\'s retirement last year. [SpaceX\\'s Dragon Arrives at Space Station (Pictures)]\\n\\n\"It was an effort that will revolutionize the way we carry out space exploration, with the private sector taking over responsibility for transportation to the ISS,\" NASA chief Charlie Bolden said in a congratulatory call to the space station crew today. \"This will free NASA up to focus on the really hard stuff, like sending our astronauts to an asteroid and, eventually, on to Mars.\"\\n\\nSpaceX holds a $1.6 billion NASA contract to make 12 robotic supply runs to the orbiting lab with Dragon and its Falcon 9 rocket, and the capsule\\'s performance on its current demonstration mission is making that look like a good investment.\\n\\nAs long as Dragon is able to make its way back to Earth safely, the first of those 12 bona fide cargo missions will likely blast off this September, NASA officials said. (The capsule is slated to depart the station on May 31 and splash down in the Pacific Ocean off California, where it will be recovered by SpaceX personnel.)\\n\\n\"This truly is the beginning of a new era in commercial spaceflight,\" said Alan Lindenmoyer, manager of NASA\\'s Commercial Crew and Cargo Program.\\n\\nThough today\\'s press conference was held in Houston, Musk and Lindenmoyer joined in from SpaceX\\'s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif. Their words were often drowned out by the cheers of ecstatic SpaceX personnel celebrating the successful orbital meet-up between Dragon and the $100 billion space station.\\n\\nSpaceX\\'s big dreams\\n\\nMusk founded SpaceX in 2002 with one primary goal in mind — to help humanity settle worlds beyond Earth. And today\\'s docking brings that ambitious aim a little closer to reality, he said.\\n\\n\"I\\'m really excited, because this was a crucial step,\" Musk said. \"It makes the things in the future — and the ultimate path toward humanity becoming a multiplanet species — much, much more likely. The chances of that happening just went up dramatically, so people should be really excited about that.\"\\n\\nBefore we can think seriously about colonizing other worlds, Musk has said, the cost of spaceflight needs to come down considerably. Toward this end, SpaceX is working to develop a fully reusable rocket, in contrast with the expendable launch vehicles in widespread use today.\\n\\n\"The cost of the fuel is only about 0.3 percent of the cost of the mission,\" Musk said. \"So if rockets can be made reusable, then it\\'s possible to reduce the cost of spaceflight maybe by a factor of 100 or more.\"\\n\\nSpaceX is also upgrading Dragon to carry crew, and it hopes to be flying astronauts to the space station within the next three years or so. Manned flights to destinations beyond low-Earth orbit, such as Mars, may come into the company\\'s sights after that.\\n\\nYou can follow SPACE.com senior writer Mike Wall on Twitter: @michaeldwall.

              " 'Bing has been unceremoniously dumped by Facebook. The social network had been using the Microsoft search tool to power its Graph Search platform for some time now, but no longer. While no announcement has been made, Facebook confirmed the news to Reuters.\\n\\nThe lack of official announcement meant that the dropping of Bing was immediately noticed. Facebook does not have a replacement partner in mind -- there is no danger of the social network teaming up with Google -- but will go it alone instead.\\n\\nIt seems that the decision tied in with Facebook\\'s recent updating of its own search tool. A few days ago, the search tool was updated to make it possible to find specific posts rather than users and pages. This made Facebook Search more like a \"proper\" search engine, and probably led to questions about the value of maintaining links with Bing. But there are other reasons behind ditching Bing.\\n\\nFacebook issued a statement to VentureBeat in which it explained the switch in focus:\\n\\nWe\\'re not currently showing web search results in Facebook Search because we\\'re focused on helping people find what\\'s been shared with them on Facebook.\\n\\nWhile Microsoft will undoubtedly be unhappy with Facebook\\'s decision, it\\'s one that will probably go down well with users of the site. The move is an interesting one, if not one that is entirely surprising. The problem with using Bing to display web search results within Facebook was that it did just that -- display search results from the wider web rather than just Facebook.\\n\\nThis meant that while there was arguably a better experience for users thanks to the extra features, there was a far stronger risk that people would navigate away from Facebook and stop consuming ads. It\\'s not yet clear whether Facebook will start to cast its search net wider, displaying results and pages in a closely controlled built-in browser, but this is certainly something to look out for further down the line.\\n\\nPhoto credit: 1000 Words /Shutterstock',\n",
